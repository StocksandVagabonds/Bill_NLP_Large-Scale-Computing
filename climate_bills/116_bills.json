SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``International Climate Accountability \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In Paris, on December 12, 2015, parties to the United \n        Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reached \n        a landmark agreement to combat climate change and to accelerate \n        and intensify the actions and investments needed for a \n        sustainable low carbon future.\n            (2) The Paris Agreement's central aim is to strengthen--\n                    (A) international cooperation among parties on \n                reducing global greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate \n                the threat of climate change by keeping a global \n                average temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius \n                above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to \n                limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 \n                degrees Celsius; and\n                    (B) ambition towards achieving global greenhouse \n                gas emission reductions sufficient to reaching the \n                goals of the Paris Agreement by requiring parties to \n                make their own nationally determined contribution (NDC) \n                of greenhouse gas emission reductions.\n            (3) The Paris Agreement is the premier intergovernmental \n        forum and mechanism at the disposal of the United States for \n        protecting and advancing United States strategic and economic \n        interests in a changing, low-carbon, global economy.\n            (4) The enhanced transparency and reporting framework \n        established under the Paris Agreement will provide an effective \n        means of holding other parties accountable for their \n        commitments.\n            (5) The United States is playing a leading role in the \n        development of procedures and guidelines to implement the \n        transparency framework under the Paris Agreement.\n            (6) Since May 31, 2017, more than 400 United States mayors \n        have adopted the Paris Agreement goals for their cities and 24 \n        United States governors have formed a bipartisan coalition to \n        realize the Paris Agreement goals at the State level.\n            (7) The Paris Agreement--\n                    (A) notes the importance of ``climate justice'' \n                when mitigating and adapting to climate change; and\n                    (B) recognizes ``the need for an effective and \n                progressive response to the urgent threat of climate \n                change''.\n            (8) The cost of inaction on climate change will have \n        devastating impacts to the United States economy, costing \n        billions of dollars in lost GDP.\n            (9) The Paris Agreement further requires each party to \n        update its nationally determined contribution every 5 years, \n        and these NDC should reflect the party's highest possible \n        ambition.\n            (10) The United States communicated its first nationally \n        determined contribution to achieve an economy-wide target of \n        reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below \n        its 2005 level in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its \n        emissions by 28 percent.\n            (11) A number of existing laws, regulations, and other \n        mandatory measures in the United States are relevant to \n        achieving this target, including the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n        7401 et seq.), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-\n        486), and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 \n        (Public Law 110-140).\n            (12) On June 1, 2017, President Donald J. Trump announced \n        his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris \n        Agreement, negotiate our way back into Paris, or ``negotiate a \n        new deal''.\n            (13) Withdrawal from the Paris Agreement would leave the \n        United States as the only UNFCCC member state that is not a \n        signatory to the Paris Agreement.\n            (14) Dozens of foreign heads of state have expressed \n        support for the United States to remain a party to the Paris \n        Agreement.\n            (15) Leading companies across major economic sectors \n        believe that the participation of the United States in the \n        Paris Agreement strengthens United States employment, growth, \n        and competitiveness and that withdrawal from the Agreement \n        would put United States companies at a competitive \n        disadvantage.\n            (16) Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, the earliest \n        possible effective withdrawal date by the United States is \n        November 4, 2020. However, the United States is still obligated \n        to maintain certain commitments under the United Nations \n        Framework Convention on Climate Change, such as continuing to \n        report its emissions to the United Nations.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO ADVANCE THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE \n              UNITED STATES FROM THE PARIS AGREEMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \nfunds are authorized to be appropriated, obligated, or expended to take \nany action to advance the withdrawal of the United States from the \nParis Agreement.\n    (b) Rule of Construction.--Subsection (a) shall not be construed to \nconstrain or prohibit the United States Government from participating \nin the implementation and execution of the Paris Agreement, including \nmeeting current obligations under the Paris Agreements and the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nSEC. 4. PLAN FOR THE UNITED STATES TO MEET ITS NATIONALLY DETERMINED \n              CONTRIBUTION UNDER THE PARIS AGREEMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the President shall develop and submit to the \nappropriate congressional committees and make available to the public a \nplan for the United States to meet its nationally determined \ncontribution under the Paris Agreement. The plan shall describe--\n            (1) how the United States will achieve an economy-wide \n        target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 \n        percent below its 2005 level by 2025; and\n            (2) how the United States will use the Paris Agreement's \n        transparency provisions to confirm that other parties to the \n        Agreement with major economies are fulfilling their announced \n        contributions to the Agreement.\n    (b) Updates to Plan.--Not later than one year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the President shall \nsubmit to the appropriate congressional committees and make available \nto the public an updated plan under subsection (a).\n    (c) Successive Nationally Determined Contributions.--The updated \nplan developed pursuant to subsection (c) may serve as the United \nStates' successive NDC, in accordance with Article 4.3 of the Paris \nAgreement, and may be communicated to the United Nations Secretary-\nGeneral in accordance with Article 4.9 of the Paris Agreement.\n    (d) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this section, \nthe term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n            (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on \n        Environment and Public Works, the Committee on Energy and \n        Natural Resources, the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n        Forestry, and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate; \n        and\n            (2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on \n        Energy and Commerce, the Committee on Agriculture, and the \n        Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.\n\nSEC. 5.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) climate change poses a significant and increasing \n        threat to the growth and stability of the economy of the United \n        States;\n            (2) many sectors of the economy of the United States and \n        many businesses in the United States are exposed to multiple \n        channels of climate-related risk, which may include exposure \n        to--\n                    (A) the physical impacts of climate change, \n                including the rise of the average global temperature, \n                accelerating sea-level rise, desertification, ocean \n                acidification, intensification of storms, increase in \n                heavy precipitation, more frequent and intense \n                temperature extremes, more severe droughts, and longer \n                wildfire seasons;\n                    (B) the economic disruptions and security threats \n                that result from the physical impacts described in \n                subparagraph (A), including conflicts over scarce \n                resources, conditions conducive to violent extremism, \n                the spread of infectious diseases, and forced \n                migration; and\n                    (C) the transition impacts that result as the \n                global economy transitions to a clean and renewable \n                energy, low-emissions economy, including financial \n                impacts as fossil fuel assets risk becoming stranded \n                and it becomes uneconomic for companies to develop \n                fossil fuel assets as policymakers act to limit the \n                worst impacts of climate change by keeping the rise in \n                average global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above \n                pre-industrial levels;\n            (3) assessing the potential impact of climate-related risks \n        on national and international financial systems is an urgent \n        concern;\n            (4) companies have a duty to disclose financial risks that \n        climate change presents to their investors, lenders, and \n        insurers;\n            (5) the Commission has a duty to promote a risk-informed \n        securities market that is worthy of the trust of the public as \n        families invest for their futures;\n            (6) investors, lenders, and insurers are increasingly \n        demanding climate risk information that is consistent, \n        comparable, reliable, and clear;\n            (7) including standardized, material climate change risk \n        and opportunity disclosure that is useful for decision makers \n        in annual reports to the Commission will increase transparency \n        with respect to risk accumulation and exposure in financial \n        markets;\n            (8) requiring companies to disclose climate-related risk \n        exposure and risk management strategies will encourage a \n        smoother transition to a clean and renewable energy, low-\n        emissions economy and guide capital allocation to mitigate, and \n        adapt to, the effects of climate change and limit damages \n        associated with climate-related events and disasters; and\n            (9) a critical component in fighting climate change is a \n        transparent accounting of the risks that climate change \n        presents and the implications of continued inaction with \n        respect to climate change.\n\nSEC. 4.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n        Change, the Earth's climate is now changing faster than at any \n        point in history.\n            (2) The October 2018 report entitled ``Special Report on \n        Global Warming of 1.5\u000f C'' by the Intergovernmental Panel on \n        Climate Change and the November 2018 Fourth National Climate \n        Assessment report found that a changing climate is--\n                    (A) causing sea levels to rise;\n                    (B) contributing to an increase in wildfires and \n                temperature extremes in some parts of the world; and\n                    (C) contributing to an increase in heavy \n                precipitation in certain locations.\n            (3) Forced displacement and forced migration are increasing \n        in the context of environmental changes and climate-induced \n        disruptions, including weather-related disasters, drought, \n        famine, and rising sea levels.\n            (4) Climate-related events and disasters are causing a \n        person to be displaced from his or her home every second.\n            (5) The United Nations Human Rights Council has recognized \n        that climate change poses an existential threat that has \n        already had a negative impact on the fulfilment of human \n        rights, specifically noting that--\n                    (A) parties should, when taking action to address \n                climate change, respect, promote and consider their \n                respective obligations on human rights; and\n                    (B) the adverse effects of climate change are felt \n                most acutely by those segments of the population that \n                are already in vulnerable situations owing to factors \n                such as geography, poverty, gender, age, indigenous or \n                minority status, national or social origin, birth or \n                other status and disability.\n            (6) The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for \n        Human Rights has suggested that a person who cannot be \n        reasonably expected to return to his or her country of origin--\n                    (A) should be considered a victim of forced \n                displacement; and\n                    (B) should be granted at least a temporary stay in \n                the country where they have found refuge.\n            (7) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change affirms \n        with high confidence that societal adaptations in the near term \n        can help reduce the risks of climate change throughout the 21st \n        century.\n            (8) Since 2013, typhoons and storms in the Philippines have \n        displaced nearly 15,000,000 people.\n            (9) Violence in Burma's Rakhine State has forced nearly \n        1,000,000 Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh, where they are \n        exposed to the country's vulnerability to the effects of \n        extreme flooding and landslides worsened by climate change.\n            (10) In 2019, extreme flooding in Northern and Northeast \n        India displaced at least 3,000,000 people, including almost \n        2,000,000 people in the Northern Indian state of Bihar and more \n        than 1,700,000 people in Northeastern Assam state.\n            (11) The small Pacific island Nation of Kiribati is \n        preparing for large swaths of the country to be uninhabitable \n        and for its people to migrate with the skill to integrate into \n        their new host nation.\n            (12) More than 150,000,000 people around the world now live \n        on land that will be below sea level or regular flood levels by \n        the end of the century unless adaptation measures are taken.\n            (13) The effects of climate change also exacerbate social, \n        economic, and political tensions within and among nations.\n            (14) In 2014, the Department of Defense Quadrennial Defense \n        Review cited the effects of climate change as a ``threat \n        multiplier'' that could aggravate stressors abroad.\n            (15) In 2016, a memorandum from the National Intelligence \n        Counsel entitled ``Implications for U.S. National Security of \n        Anticipated Climate Change'' highlighted how climate change \n        could create or inflame tensions between nations in already \n        disputed regions, such as the Arctic.\n            (16) Continued climate change will drive further \n        displacement. According to the International Organization for \n        Migration, by 2050, there could be as many as 200,000,000 \n        climate-displaced persons, including those who are internally \n        displaced.\n            (17) The United States has not systematically acted to \n        address climate displacement or to provide appropriate durable \n        solutions to those who are displaced.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United \nStates should--\n            (1) reduce its domestic greenhouse gas emissions on a scale \n        and rate proportionate to its historical responsibility and the \n        urgency of the threat of climate change;\n            (2) welcome the shared responsibility of climate change \n        adaptation, global disaster risk reduction, resiliency \n        building, and disaster response and recovery;\n            (3) assist in providing durable solutions for climate-\n        displaced persons;\n            (4) aid other countries in their climate change mitigation \n        efforts; and\n            (5) work with the international community--\n                    (A) to establish a framework to share such \n                responsibilities; and\n                    (B) to ensure that the human rights of climate-\n                displaced persons are acknowledged, respected, \n                protected, and fulfilled.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 101(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n1101(a)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking paragraph (8) and inserting the following:\n    ``(8) The term `climate-displaced person' means any person who, for \nreasons of sudden or progressive change in the environment that \nadversely affects his or her life or living conditions--\n            ``(A) is obliged to leave his or her habitual home, either \n        within his or her country of nationality or in another country;\n            ``(B) is in need of a durable resettlement solution; and\n            ``(C) whose government cannot or will not provide such \n        durable resettlement solution.''; and\n            (2) by amending paragraph (34) to read as follows:\n    ``(34) The term `designated application center' means any United \nStates embassy or consulate, or other facility as the Secretary of \nState may delegate to accept applications for climate-displaced person \nstatus.''.\n\nSEC. 4. REQUIRED DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING.\n\n    (a) Data Collection.--The President, in coordination with the \nDepartment of Commerce, the Environmental Protection Agency, the \nDepartment of State, the Director of National Intelligence, the \nDepartment of Defense, and other relevant agencies, shall collect and \nmaintain data on displacement caused by climate change, including \ninformation from--\n            (1) the International Organization for Migration;\n            (2) the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees;\n            (3) UNICEF; and\n            (4) other international organizations that are collecting \n        such data.\n    (b) Annual Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the President shall \nsubmit a report to the appropriate congressional committees that \ndetails the collection and analysis of the data described in subsection \n(a). The report required under this subsection shall be submitted in \nunclassified form, but may include a classified annex.\n\nSEC. 5. GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE STRATEGY.\n\n    Section 117 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151p) \nis amended--\n            (1) in subsection (b)--\n                    (A) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(b)'';

and\n            ``(ii) reduce the vulnerability of persons affected by \n        climate change.\n    ``(B) There shall be, in the Department of State, a Coordinator of \nClimate Change Resilience, who shall coordinate the assistance \nauthorized under this paragraph.''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(d)(1) The Secretary of State, in coordination with the \nAdministrator of the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, shall establish a comprehensive, integrated, 10-year \nstrategy, which shall be referred to as the `Global Climate Change \nResilience Strategy', to mitigate the impacts of climate change on \ndisplacement and humanitarian emergencies.\n    ``(2) The Global Climate Change Resilience Strategy shall--\n            ``(A) focus on addressing slow-onset and rapid-onset \n        effects of events caused by climate change;\n            ``(B) consider the effects of events caused by climate \n        change;\n            ``(C) describe the key features of successful strategies to \n        prevent such conditions;\n            ``(D) include specific objectives and multisectoral \n        approaches to the effects of events caused by climate change;\n            ``(E) describe approaches that ensure national leadership, \n        as appropriate, and substantively engage with civil society, \n        local partners, and the affected communities, including \n        marginalized populations and underserved populations, in the \n        design, implementation, and monitoring of climate change \n        programs to best safeguard the future of those subject to \n        displacement;\n            ``(F) assign roles for relevant Federal agencies to avoid \n        duplication of efforts, while ensuring that--\n                    ``(i) the Department of State is responsible for--\n                            ``(I) leading the Global Climate Change \n                        Resilience Strategy;\n                            ``(II) establishing United States foreign \n                        policy;\n                            ``(III) advancing diplomatic and political \n                        efforts;\n                            ``(IV) guiding security assistance and \n                        related civilian security efforts to mitigate \n                        climate change threats;

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) if current trends continue, average global temperatures \n        are likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial \n        levels between 2030 and 2050;\n            (2) global temperature rise has already resulted in an \n        increased number of heavy rainstorms, coastal flooding events, \n        heat waves, wildfires, and other extreme events;\n            (3) since 1980--\n                    (A) the number of extreme weather events per year \n                that cost the people of the United States more than \n                $1,000,000,000 per event, accounting for inflation, has \n                increased significantly; and\n                    (B) the total cost of extreme weather events in the \n                United States has exceeded $1,100,000,000,000;\n            (4) as physical impacts from climate change are manifested \n        across multiple sectors of the economy of the United States--\n                    (A) climate-related economic risks will continue to \n                increase;\n                    (B) climate-related extreme weather events will \n                disrupt energy and transportation systems in the United \n                States, which will result in more frequent and longer-\n                lasting power outages, fuel shortages, and service \n                disruptions in critical sectors across the economy of \n                the United States;\n                    (C) projected increases in extreme heat conditions \n                will lead to decreases in labor productivity in \n                agriculture, construction, and other critical economic \n                sectors;\n                    (D) food and livestock production will be impacted \n                in regions that experience increases in heat and \n                drought and small rural communities will struggle to \n                find the resources needed to adapt to those changes; \n                and\n                    (E) sea level rise and more frequent and intense \n                extreme weather events will--\n                            (i) increasingly disrupt and damage private \n                        property and critical infrastructure; and\n                            (ii) drastically increase insured and \n                        uninsured losses;\n            (5) advances in energy efficiency and renewable energy \n        technologies, as well as climate policies and shifting societal \n        preferences, will--\n                    (A) reduce global demand for fossil fuels; and\n                    (B) expose transition risks for fossil fuel \n                companies and investors, which could include trillions \n                of dollars of stranded assets around the world;\n            (6) climate change poses uniquely far-reaching risks to the \n        financial services industry, including with respect to \n        underwriting, credit, and market risks, due to the number of \n        sectors and locations impacted and the potentially irreversible \n        scale of damage;\n            (7) financial institutions must take a consistent approach \n        to assessing climate-related financial risks and incorporating \n        those risks into existing risk management practices, which \n        should be informed by scenario analysis;\n            (8) the Board of Governors conducts annual assessments of \n        the capital adequacy and capital planning practices of the \n        largest and most complex banking organizations (referred to in \n        this section as ``stress tests'') in order to promote a safe, \n        sound, and efficient banking and financial system;\n            (9) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the stress \n        tests conducted by the Board of Governors are not designed to \n        reflect the physical risks or transition risks posed by climate \n        change; and\n            (10) the Board of Governors--\n                    (A) has the authority to take into account the \n                potentially systemic impact of climate-related risks on \n                the financial system; and\n                    (B) should develop new analytical tools with longer \n                time horizons to accurately assess and manage the risks \n                described in subparagraph (A).\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Targeting Environmental and Climate \nRecklessness Act of 2019''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) There is strong global support for actions that limit \n        the severity of climate change.\n            (2) On September 18, 2019, more than 200 representatives of \n        environmental groups, human rights groups, indigenous peoples, \n        workers, and academia adopted a declaration calling on \n        governments to urgently address environmental damage, including \n        by increasing the pressure on those most responsible for \n        climate change.\n            (3) The United States Government has developed and \n        implements targeted measures to restrict access to the United \n        States financial system for specific individuals and entities \n        involved in conduct including malicious cyber-enabled activity, \n        transnational organized crime, narcotics trafficking, \n        terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, human \n        rights abuse, and corruption. Those conduct-based measures \n        apply globally and are not focused on any specific country.\n            (4) As of the date of the enactment of this Act, the United \n        States Government seeks to apply existing sanctions authorities \n        against individuals and entities engaged in wildlife \n        trafficking. On January 30, 2018, the Office of Foreign Assets \n        Control designated an organization for engaging in illicit \n        activities including the trafficking of endangered and \n        vulnerable animals such as black bears, pangolins, tigers, \n        rhinoceroses, and elephants.\n            (5) Climate change has disproportionate impact on poorer \n        communities and individuals in less developed countries. \n        Targeted measures against individuals and entities most \n        responsible for exacerbating climate change could help ensure \n        that efforts to address climate change do not worsen global \n        inequality.\n            (6) Development of carbon-intensive electrical power plants \n        is continuing across the developing world through new foreign \n        investments, despite broad awareness of the dangers.\n            (7) The current investment plans of countries likely to \n        receive significant foreign energy investments may lead to an \n        excess build-out of fossil fuel assets and create carbon \n        ``lock-in'' absent urgent action.\n            (8) Governments that are investing in or directing foreign \n        investment toward legacy fossil fuel energy generation often \n        lack the incentive to formulate more efficient or sustainable \n        national energy policies. Those governments are thus likely to \n        default to established but harmful forms of energy generation.\n            (9) Alternatives to carbon-intensive electrical power \n        generation are now available and technological advancements \n        continue to strengthen the economic competitiveness of such \n        alternatives.\n            (10) Corruption is especially harmful when individuals who \n        abuse positions of influence for personal gain can \n        simultaneously cause great damage to the global commons by \n        facilitating significant increases in the emission of, or \n        decreases in the absorption of, greenhouse gases.\n            (11) Deforestation is doubly damaging because it undercuts \n        the absorption of carbon dioxide, while also raising greenhouse \n        gas emissions.\n            (12) According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n        Change, most pathways to limit warming to well below 2 degrees \n        Celsius require reduced deforestation in concert with \n        reforestation, afforestation, and bioenergy efforts.\n            (13) From 2013 to 2019, some of the largest financial \n        institutions in the world provided tens of billions of dollars \n        in financing to entities either directly or indirectly \n        deforesting the largest rainforests in the world. Most \n        financial institutions have no internal policy covering \n        dealings in key forest-risk commodities.\n            (14) On September 22, 2019, 130 financial institutions \n        worth $47,000,000,000,000 collectively, representing \\1/3\\ of \n        the global industry, signed on to the United Nations-backed \n        Principles for Responsible Banking, committing to strategically \n        align their businesses with the goals of the agreement of the \n        parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \n        Change, done at Paris December 12, 2015, and entered into force \n        November 4, 2016 (in this Act referred to as the ``Paris \n        Climate Agreement''), and the Sustainable Development Goals \n        adopted by all United Nations member countries in 2015.\n            (15) Illegal deforestation causes environmental harm while \n        promoting criminal activity. In the Brazilian Amazon, criminal \n        networks with the capacity to coordinate large-scale \n        extraction, processing, and sale of timber deploy armed \n        personnel to protect their interests. They regularly kill and \n        threaten people who stand in the way of criminal activity, \n        including members of indigenous communities and environmental \n        enforcement officials. Perpetrators of violence are rarely \n        brought to justice.\n            (16) Between 2002 and 2017, 1,558 people in 50 countries \n        were killed for defending their environments and lands. \n        Environmental defenders currently face a wave of violence that \n        includes threats of physical harm, intimidation, and \n        criminalization.\n            (17) Policies and measures to address climate change must \n        also promote human rights, thereby advancing equality, justice, \n        and dignity for all, in line with the Sustainable Development \n        Goals of the United Nations.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING \n              CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the restrictive measures described in this Act are only \n        one component of the comprehensive approach needed to address \n        climate change and mitigate its effects;\n            (2) the United States Government must ensure through law \n        and regulation that United States entities are not engaged in \n        any of the egregious behaviors for which foreign persons may be \n        targeted under this Act;\n            (3) the United States Government must recommit to the Paris \n        Climate Agreement and commit to any successor agreement;\n            (4) the United States Government must fulfill its pledges \n        to the Green Climate Fund and promote international efforts to \n        support climate change adaptation and mitigation;\n            (5) the United States Government must work proactively with \n        foreign governments, including by offering positive incentives, \n        to address climate change and to promote economic development \n        in ways that do not needlessly increase carbon emissions or \n        increase the risk of corruption;\n            (6) the restrictive measures described in this Act should \n        be employed if engagement has failed to prevent significant \n        actions that exacerbate climate change; and\n            (7) given broad international support for countering \n        climate change, the Secretary of State should encourage the \n        governments of other countries to implement restrictive \n        measures that are similar to the provisions of this Act in \n        order to increase the effectiveness of actions taken by the \n        United States to combat significant actions that exacerbate \n        climate change, including related corruption and human rights \n        violations.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF \n              CHINA.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the United States Government should encourage the \n        People's Republic of China to follow through on its stated \n        intentions to reduce the negative environmental impacts of \n        Chinese foreign investment, including investments provided \n        through the Belt and Road Initiative;\n            (2) the United States Government should negotiate a binding \n        agreement to end fossil fuel subsidies with major economies \n        including the People's Republic of China;\n            (3) the United States Government should build on the \n        successes of existing engagement with the People's Republic of \n        China through the United States-China Clean Energy Research \n        Center and other initiatives to launch new cooperative efforts;\n            (4) the United States Government should engage in expanded \n        dialogue with the People's Republic of China to ensure that \n        development finance institutions do not undermine global \n        decarbonization efforts; and\n            (5) the United States Government should work with the \n        People's Republic of China to develop and adopt safeguards to \n        promote low-carbon, climate-resilient investments over high-\n        carbon, climate risk-inducing investments, particularly in \n        emerging and developing economies in the Indo-Pacific, Africa, \n        and Latin America.\n\nSEC. 5.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Under the previous administration, FEMA's 2014-2018 \n        Strategic Plan explicitly mentioned and referenced climate \n        change as a source of changing and increasing national disaster \n        risks, in the near and long term, that--\n                    (A) must be effectively integrated into the \n                Agency's risk assessment resources and processes; and\n                    (B) the entire emergency management community will \n                need to adapt appropriately to as they strengthen their \n                risk management programs.\n            (2) In FEMA's 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, despite the \n        mounting threat posed by climate change, the term ``climate \n        change'' is entirely absent from the text.\n            (3) It is the general consensus of the global scientific \n        community that--\n                    (A) the evidence of climate change is unequivocal;\n                    (B) anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the \n                primary cause of climate change; and\n                    (C) as a direct result of climate change, sea \n                levels are rising and extreme weather events are \n                becoming more commonplace and severe.\n            (4) The last 5 years have been the warmest years on record \n        since the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began \n        recording global air temperatures in 1895.\n            (5) 2017, one of the three warmest years on record, was \n        also the most expensive year on record for emergency disaster \n        costs in the United States due to 16 weather and climate \n        disasters.\n            (6) It is the mission of FEMA to reduce the loss of life \n        and property and protect our institutions from all hazards by \n        leading and supporting the Nation in a comprehensive, risk-\n        based emergency management program of mitigation, preparedness, \n        response, and recovery.\n            (7) It is detrimental to the mission of FEMA, and the \n        Agency's ability to follow its mandate, to explicitly or \n        implicitly deny or ignore the existence of climate change or \n        the implications of such on national security and national \n        emergency management.\n            (8) To fully and effectively carry out its mandate, FEMA \n        must comprehensively assess and incorporate the current and \n        future natural disaster risks and impacts posed by climate \n        change throughout the Agency's policies, plans, programs, \n        strategies, and operations.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) India is the second most populous country in the world \n        with a population of approximately 1,334,000,000 people and the \n        fifth largest economy in the world with a nominal gross \n        domestic product of $2,940,000,000,000.\n            (2) India is among the countries most vulnerable to climate \n        change, with hundreds of millions of people susceptible to \n        events exacerbated by climate change, such as the spread of \n        infectious diseases, sea level rise and extreme flooding, \n        droughts, storms, and landslides triggered by extreme weather.\n            (3) India releases approximately 2,500,000,000 tons (carbon \n        dioxide equivalent) in greenhouse gases annually, making it the \n        third largest greenhouse gas emitter after China and the United \n        States. India ranks seventh in the world in cumulative \n        historical emissions and is the twelfth largest greenhouse gas \n        emitter per capita.\n            (4) India has one of the largest energy markets in the \n        world, and energy capacity in India has increased by 17.5 \n        percent in 5 years to 365 gigawatts of installed electricity \n        capacity.\n            (5) Per capita energy consumption in India is relatively \n        low among emerging economic powers.\n            (6) Reliable access to power is crucial for the storage of \n        vaccines and antiretroviral and other lifesaving medical drugs, \n        as well as for the operation of modern lifesaving medical \n        equipment.\n            (7) Access to power can also provide improved information \n        and communication technologies that can greatly improve health \n        and education outcomes, as well as economic and commercial \n        opportunities.\n            (8) In 2000, only 43 percent of the population of India had \n        access to power. That percentage has more than doubled in the \n        last 20 years, with approximately 700,000,000 people in India \n        gaining access to electricity between 2000 and 2018.\n            (9) Prime Minister Narendra Modi has prioritized improving \n        citizen access to electricity and electrifying every household \n        in India.\n            (10) The Power for All initiative of the Government of \n        India aims to provide electricity to all households in India 24 \n        hours a day, 7 days a week.\n            (11) Providing around-the-clock electricity will require \n        India to double its electricity output by 2030 at an estimated \n        cost of $250,000,000,000, which will create more than \n        $30,000,000,000 in investment opportunities.\n            (12) As of August 2020, coal makes up the largest domestic \n        source of energy supply and electricity generation for India. \n        Renewable energy comprises approximately 35 percent of energy \n        generation in India.\n            (13) India imports 80 percent of its oil needs, and that \n        amount is projected to increase in the coming decades due to \n        aging oil fields and a lack of new oil discoveries in India. \n        India is increasing its oil refining capacity to maintain \n        supply to meet the rising demand for energy.\n            (14) India is projected to surpass the People's Republic of \n        China in oil consumption by 2030.\n            (15) On September 22, 2020, the People's Republic of China \n        announced a pledge to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2060 \n        in its updated Nationally Determined Contribution to the Paris \n        Agreement, done at Paris December 12, 2015, but given the need \n        to accelerate the reduction of global emissions along a 2050 \n        timeline, that pledge is proportionally insufficient to avoid \n        an increase of 2 degrees Celsius in the global average \n        temperature.\n            (16) India, in contrast, is demonstrating that energy \n        security is a priority through concrete steps including \n        creating a unified national power system and incorporating \n        varied forms of renewable energy to diversify its power \n        sources.\n            (17) India's unconditional emissions target, as outlined in \n        the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of India to the \n        Paris Agreement, aims to reduce carbon emissions in India by 33 \n        percent to 35 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.\n            (18) In its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, \n        India set a goal of generating 175 gigawatts of renewable \n        energy by 2022, which India aimed to achieve by generating 100 \n        gigawatts of solar energy, 60 gigawatts of wind energy, and 15 \n        gigawatts of energy from other sources such as biomass and \n        small hydro.\n            (19) India has pledged to increase the share of its \n        installed electricity capacity that comes from non-fossil fuel \n        sources to 40 percent by 2030.\n            (20) India is among the top 5 clean energy producers \n        globally. Installed electricity capacity from renewables in \n        India grew by 144 percent from 2014 to 2020, and between 2014 \n        and 2019 there was approximately $42,000,000,000 in investment \n        in the renewable energy sector in India.\n            (21) Numerous global funds, private equity firms, and \n        multilateral finance institutions are continuing to invest \n        billions of dollars in the growing renewable energy sector in \n        India.\n            (22) India plays a critical leadership role in Mission \n        Innovation, a global initiative in which the United States \n        participates that has the goal of accelerating the pace of \n        clean energy innovation to achieve performance breakthroughs \n        and cost reductions that will enable the provision of \n        affordable and reliable clean energy solutions.\n            (23) India leads the International Solar Alliance, an 86-\n        country initiative to mobilize $1,000,000,000,000 in solar \n        energy investment by 2030, to which the United States does not \n        belong.\n            (24) Increased ownership of appliances and cooling needs \n        could lead to a doubling or even tripling of energy use in \n        India by 2040. One billion air conditioning units are expected \n        to be in use in India by 2050.\n            (25) Under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on \n        Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, done at Montreal \n        September 16, 1987, India has agreed to freeze its \n        manufacturing and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons in 2028.\n            (26) In 2009, the United States and India established a \n        formal energy cooperation dialogue, the United States-India \n        Energy Dialogue, which included the Partnership to Advance \n        Clean Energy initiative focusing on research into, deployment \n        of, and access to clean energy.\n            (27) The Partnership to Advance Clean Energy Research \n        element of the Partnership to Advance Clean Energy initiative, \n        commonly referred to as ``PACE-R'', consists of research \n        consortia under the Joint Clean Energy Research and Development \n        Center launched in 2010 by the Department of Energy and the \n        Government of India with support from the private sector. PACE-\n        R has focused on solar power, advanced biofuels, energy \n        efficiency, and smart grids and energy storage.\n            (28) The Partnership to Advance Clean Energy Deployment \n        element of the Partnership to Advance Clean Energy initiative, \n        commonly referred to as ``PACE-D'', funds programs to improve \n        energy efficiency, grid connectivity, clean energy finance, and \n        more.\n            (29) The Partnership to Advance Clean Energy Access element \n        of the Partnership to Advance Clean Energy initiative, commonly \n        referred to as ``PEACE'', has focused on finance and technology \n        innovation, skills development, and ecosystem strengthening for \n        clean energy.\n            (30) In 2018, the United States Government established the \n        Asia Enhancing Development and Growth through Energy \n        initiative, commonly referred to as ``Asia EDGE'', to support \n        sustainable and secure energy markets throughout the Indo-\n        Pacific. Asia EDGE integrates elements of the Partnership to \n        Advance Clean Energy initiative along with new programs such as \n        the South Asia Group for Energy.\n            (31) In 2018, the Governments of India and the United \n        States established the U.S.-India Strategic Energy Partnership, \n        which includes pillars of cooperation on renewable energy and \n        sustainable growth.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Change Diplomacy and \nDevelopment Act of 2020''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The planet risks increasingly catastrophic impacts \n        unless global average temperatures are limited to no more than \n        2 \u000fC, aiming for 1.5 \u000fC above preindustrial levels.\n            (2) According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n        Change's Special Report on 1.5 \u000fC, limiting warming to no more \n        than 1.5 \u000fC requires fast mitigation of both CO&lt;INF&gt;2&lt;/INF&gt; and \n        non-CO&lt;INF&gt;2&lt;/INF&gt; climate pollutants, as well as the \n        protection and expansion of forests and other sinks that remove \n        and store CO&lt;INF&gt;2&lt;/INF&gt;, along with other strategies for \n        removing CO&lt;INF&gt;2&lt;/INF&gt; and other climate pollutants.\n            (3) Forced displacement and forced migration are \n        increasingly caused or exacerbated by environmental changes and \n        climate-induced disruptions.\n            (4) The United National Human Rights Council has recognized \n        that climate change poses an existential threat that has \n        already had a negative impact on the fulfillment of human \n        rights.\n            (5) To have a chance at limiting warming to 1.5 \u000fC and \n        avoiding increasingly severe impacts from climate change, the \n        Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that \n        global net anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions must fall by \n        45 percent from global 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net-zero \n        by 2050.\n            (6) Failure to act on the climate crisis leads to higher \n        levels of warming and exposes all regions of the world to \n        potentially catastrophic insecurity and destabilization that \n        could cause a breakdown of economies, social systems, and \n        political institutions in ways that are likely irreversible. It \n        is in the interest of the United States to place a high \n        priority on strengthening the global response to the threat of \n        climate change.\n            (7) United States leadership and ingenuity are central to \n        solving the climate crisis. The United States must act \n        urgently, guided by science, and in concert with the \n        international community to significantly reduce emissions, \n        prepare for climate impacts, and drive progress through \n        international negotiations to maintain a livable climate for \n        today and future generations.\n            (8) The United States can also build strong scientific and \n        security partnerships and reinforce the United States ability \n        to lead on other key global priorities through climate \n        diplomacy. These efforts can foster climate security while \n        creating new opportunities for United States leadership, \n        economic growth, and innovation.\n            (9) The United States is a Party to the United Nations \n        Framework Convention on Climate Change (referred to in this Act \n        as the ``Convention''), as agreed to by the advice and consent \n        of the Senate on October 7, 1992, and should remain actively \n        engaged in the Convention.\n            (10) In Paris, on December 12, 2015, parties to the \n        Convention reached a landmark agreement to strengthen the \n        global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a \n        global temperature rise well below 2 \u000fC above pre-industrial \n        levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase \n        even further to 1.5 \u000fC.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United \nStates should--\n            (1) utilize multilateral and bilateral foreign assistance \n        to promote low-carbon, climate-resilient development, including \n        supporting greater participation of women in the development \n        and implementation of climate policies that are gender-\n        responsive; and\n            (2) advance clean energy and climate resilience through \n        budgeting and operations of United States Government facilities \n        abroad.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Adaptation.--The term ``adaptation'' means an \n        adjustment in natural or human systems to a new or changing \n        environment that exploits beneficial opportunities or moderates \n        negative effects.\n            (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n        ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n                    (A) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the \n                Committee on Appropriations of the Senate; and\n                    (B) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the \n                Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n                Representatives.\n            (3) Clean energy.--The term ``clean energy'' means any \n        electricity generation, transmission, storage, heating, \n        cooling, industrial process, or manufacturing project the \n        primary purpose of which is the deployment, development, or \n        production of an energy system or technology that avoids, \n        significantly reduces, or sequesters emissions of greenhouse \n        gas or other pollutants.\n            (4) Climate change.--The term ``climate change'' means \n        anthropogenic changes in average weather conditions that \n        persist over multiple decades or longer, and encompasses both \n        increases and decreases in temperature, as well as shifts in \n        precipitation, changing risk of certain types of severe weather \n        events, and changes to other features of the climate system.\n            (5) Climate security.--The term ``climate security'' has \n        the meaning given such term in section 120 of the National \n        Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3060).\n            (6) Mitigation.--The term ``mitigation'' means measures to \n        reduce the amount or speed of future climate change, including \n        by reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases or removing carbon \n        dioxide from the atmosphere.\n            (7) Resilient.--The term ``resilient'' means the capability \n        to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, or recover from \n        significant multihazard threats with minimum damage to social \n        well-being, health, the economy, or the environment.\n\nSEC. 4.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The ocean and coastal waters of the United States are \n        foundational to the economy, security, global competitiveness, \n        and well-being of the United States and continuously serve the \n        people of the United States and other countries as an important \n        source of food, energy, economic productivity, recreation, \n        culture, beauty, and enjoyment.\n            (2) Over many years, the resource productivity and water \n        quality of the ocean and coastal areas of the United States \n        have been diminished by pollution, increasing population \n        demands, economic development, and natural and man-made hazard \n        events, both acute and chronic.\n            (3) Ocean and coastal areas of the United States are \n        managed by State and Federal resource agencies and regulated on \n        an interstate and regional scale by various overlapping Federal \n        authorities, thereby creating a significant need for interstate \n        coordination to enhance regional priorities, including the \n        ecological and economic health of those areas.\n            (4) Regional Ocean Partnerships, established by coastal \n        states working in close coordination with Federal agencies, \n        regional fisheries managers, and Tribal governments, help \n        coordinate interstate responses to critical ocean issues that \n        extend beyond individual State boundaries.\n            (5) Regional Ocean Partnerships have improved understanding \n        of climate change's impact on fish and shellfish populations, \n        have invested in identifying indicators of ocean health and \n        addressing coastal mitigation, and have played leading roles in \n        the creation and upkeep of regional ocean data portals that \n        allow for improved understanding of ocean use synergies and \n        trade-offs.\n            (6) Regional Ocean Partnerships engage in coordinated \n        efforts to protect and enhance the health of living resources \n        and engage the public in stewardship of ocean and coastal \n        areas.\n            (7) The coordination offered by Regional Ocean Partnerships \n        is particularly critical in the era of climate change, with \n        coastal and ocean resources under threat and as demand for \n        offshore resources increases.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are as follows:\n            (1) To complement and expand cooperative voluntary efforts \n        intended to manage and restore ocean and coastal areas spanning \n        across multiple State boundaries.\n            (2) To expand Federal support for monitoring, data \n        management, and restoration activities in ocean and coastal \n        areas.\n            (3) To commit the United States to a comprehensive \n        cooperative program to achieve improved water quality in, and \n        improvements in the productivity of living resources of, all \n        coastal ecosystems.\n            (4) To authorize Regional Ocean Partnerships as \n        intergovernmental coordinators for shared interstate and \n        regional priorities relating to the collaborative management of \n        the large marine ecosystems, thereby reducing duplication of \n        efforts and maximizing opportunities to leverage support in the \n        ocean and coastal regions.\n            (5) To enable Regional Ocean Partnerships, or designated \n        fiscal management entities of such partnerships, to receive \n        Federal funding to conduct the scientific research, \n        conservation and restoration activities, and priority \n        coordination on shared regional priorities necessary to achieve \n        the purposes described in paragraphs (1) through (4).\n\nSEC. 602.

Senior Coordinator for Women and Climate Change.\nSec. 202. Briefing and report.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Women in the United States and around the world are the \n        linchpin of families and communities and are often the first to \n        feel the immediate and adverse effects of social, \n        environmental, and economic stresses on their families and \n        communities.\n            (2) The United Nations has recognized, as one of the \n        central organizing principles for its work, that ``no enduring \n        solution to society's most threatening social, economic and \n        political problems can be found without the full participation, \n        and the full empowerment, of the world's women''.\n            (3) The United Nations Development Programme 2013 Human \n        Development Report has found that the number of people living \n        in extreme poverty could increase by up to 3,000,000,000 by \n        2050 unless environmental disasters are averted by coordinated \n        global action.\n            (4) Climate change is already forcing the most vulnerable \n        communities and populations in developing countries to face \n        unprecedented climate stress, including water scarcity and \n        drought, as well as severe weather events and floods, which can \n        lead to reduced agricultural productivity, food insecurity, and \n        increased disease.\n            (5) Climate change exacerbates issues of scarcity and lack \n        of accessibility to primary natural resources, forest \n        resources, and arable land for food production, thereby \n        contributing to increased conflict and instability, as well as \n        the workload and stresses on women farmers, who are estimated \n        to produce 60 to 80 percent of the food in most developing \n        countries.\n            (6) Women will disproportionately face harmful impacts from \n        climate change, particularly in poor and developing nations \n        where women regularly assume increased responsibility for \n        growing the family's food and collecting water, fuel, and other \n        resources.\n            (7) Epidemics, such as malaria and zika, are expected to \n        worsen and spread due to variations in climate, putting women \n        (especially pregnant mothers and women who hope to become \n        pregnant) and children without access to prevention and medical \n        services at risk.\n            (8) The direct and indirect effects of climate change have \n        a disproportionate impact on marginalized women, such as \n        environmental refugees and displaced persons, migrants, \n        religious, racial, or ethnic minorities, adolescent girls, \n        lesbian and trans women, women living in poverty, and women and \n        girls with disabilities and those who are living with HIV.\n            (9) Conflict has a disproportionate impact on the most \n        vulnerable communities and populations, including women, and is \n        fueled in the poorest regions of the world by harsher climates, \n        leading to migration, refugee crises, and conflicts over scarce \n        natural resources, including land and water.\n            (10) Displaced, refugee, and stateless women and girls face \n        extreme violence and threats, including--\n                    (A) being forced to exchange sex for food and \n                humanitarian supplies;\n                    (B) being at increased risk of rape, sexual \n                exploitation, and abuse; and\n                    (C) being at increased risk for HIV, sexually \n                transmitted infections (STIs), unplanned pregnancy, and \n                poor reproductive health.\n            (11) It is predicted that climate change will lead to \n        increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather \n        conditions, precipitating the occurrence of natural disasters \n        around the globe.\n            (12) The relocation and death of women, and especially \n        mothers, as a result of climate-related disasters often has \n        devastating impacts on social support networks, family ties, \n        and the coping capacity of families and communities.\n            (13) The ability of women to adapt to climate change is \n        constrained by a lack of economic freedoms, property and \n        inheritance rights, and access to financial resources, \n        education, family planning and reproductive health, and new \n        tools, equipment, and technology.\n            (14) Despite having a unique capacity and knowledge to \n        promote and provide for adaptation to climate change, women \n        often have insufficient resources to undertake such adaptation.\n            (15) Women are shown to have a multiplier effect because \n        women use their income and resources, when given the necessary \n        tools, to increase the well-being of their children and \n        families, and thus play a critical role in reducing food \n        insecurity, poverty, and socioeconomic effects of climate \n        change.\n            (16) Women are often underrepresented in the development \n        and formulation of policy regarding mitigation and adaptation \n        to climate change, even though women are often in the best \n        position to provide and consult on adaptive strategies.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Action Now Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In Paris, on December 12, 2015, parties to the United \n        Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reached \n        a landmark agreement to combat climate change and to accelerate \n        and intensify the actions and investments needed for a \n        sustainable low carbon future.\n            (2) The Paris Agreement's central aim is to strengthen the \n        global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a \n        global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-\n        industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the \n        temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n            (3) The Paris Agreement specifies the need for a strong \n        global response to climate change and when taking action, the \n        need to respect, promote, and safeguard the right to health now \n        and for future generations.\n            (4) The Paris Agreement acknowledges that all ``Parties \n        should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, \n        promote and consider their respective obligations on human \n        rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, \n        local communities, migrants, children, persons with \n        disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right \n        to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of \n        women and intergenerational equity''.\n            (5) The Paris Agreement notes the importance of ``climate \n        justice'' when mitigating and adapting to climate change and \n        recognizes ``the need for an effective and progressive response \n        to the urgent threat of climate change''.\n            (6) The Paris Agreement requires all parties to put forward \n        their best efforts through nationally determined contributions \n        (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead.\n            (7) The Paris Agreement further requires each party to \n        update its nationally determined contribution every 5 years, \n        with each successive nationally determined contribution \n        representing a progression beyond the previous nationally \n        determined contribution, and reflecting the party's highest \n        possible ambition.\n            (8) The Paris Agreement recognizes that the ocean \n        ecosystems covering more than 70 percent of the Earth's surface \n        have an integral role in climate balance. Seventy percent of \n        nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement \n        are ocean-inclusive, and 39 Paris Agreement signatories are \n        focused on the inclusion of ocean action in nationally \n        determined contributions through the Because the Ocean \n        Initiative.\n            (9) The United States communicated its nationally \n        determined contribution to achieve an economy-wide target of \n        reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below \n        its 2005 level in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its \n        emissions by 28 percent.\n            (10) A number of existing laws, regulations, and other \n        mandatory measures in the United States are relevant to \n        achieving this target, including the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n        7401 et seq.), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-\n        486), and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 \n        (Public Law 110-140).\n            (11) Essential in achieving this target is a thriving clean \n        energy industry in the United States, which currently employs \n        over 500,000 Americans.\n            (12) On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced his \n        intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris \n        Agreement, which would leave the United States as the only \n        UNFCCC member state that is not a signatory to the Paris \n        Agreement.\n            (13) Article 8 of the Paris Agreement notes Parties \n        recognize the importance of averting, minimizing and addressing \n        loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate \n        change, including extreme weather events and slow onset events, \n        and the role of sustainable development in reducing the risk of \n        loss and damage such as strong winds from hurricanes and \n        tropical storms, and flooding from storm surges and heavy rain, \n        that inflict losses on various sectors of the United States \n        economy.\n            (14) Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, the earliest \n        possible effective withdrawal date by the United States is \n        November 4, 2020. However, the United States is still obligated \n        to maintain certain commitments under the Paris Agreement, such \n        as continuing to report its emissions to the United Nations.\n            (15) The Paris Agreement further requires that parties \n        ``should strengthen their cooperation on enhancing action on \n        adaptation, taking into account the Cancun Adaptation \n        Framework'', which includes ``measures to enhance \n        understanding, coordination and cooperation with regard to \n        climate change induced displacement, migration and planned \n        relocation, where appropriate, at the national, regional and \n        international levels''.\n            (16) Article 8 of the Paris Agreement states that ``Parties \n        recognize the importance of averting, minimizing and addressing \n        loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate \n        change, including extreme weather events and slow onset \n        events'', such as sea level rise, saltwater intrusion, and \n        flooding.\n            (17) The Paris Agreement is an example of multilateral, \n        international cooperation needed to overcome challenges facing \n        the international community, such as reducing emissions, \n        promoting economic growth, and deploying clean energy \n        technologies.\n            (18) The Paris Agreement recognizes ``the fundamental \n        priority of safeguarding food security and ending hunger, and \n        the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to \n        the adverse impacts of climate change.''.\n            (19) The Paris Agreement recognizes that adaptation is a \n        global challenge faced by all with local, subnational, \n        national, regional and international dimensions, and that it is \n        a key component of and makes a contribution to the long-term \n        global response to climate change to protect people, \n        livelihoods, and ecosystems.\n            (20) American leadership encouraged widespread \n        international participation in the Paris Agreement.\n            (21) American cities, States, and businesses are stepping \n        up and pledging to meet the Paris Agreement goals in the wake \n        of absent and uncertain United States Federal leadership.\n            (22) Article 8 of the Paris Agreement states that ``Parties \n        recognize the importance of averting, minimizing and addressing \n        loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate \n        change, including extreme weather events and slow onset \n        events'' such as drought conditions and water scarcity.\n            (23) The Paris Agreement has driven innovation in \n        developing cleaner, more reliable, and more affordable forms of \n        energy, demonstrating that addressing climate change and \n        providing affordable energy to American consumers are not \n        mutually exclusive. The Paris Agreement encouraged the United \n        States to develop a Mid-Century Strategy for Deep \n        Decarbonization, which was submitted on November 16, 2016. The \n        Mid-Century Strategy for Deep Decarbonization stated that \n        ``energy efficiency improvements enable the energy system to \n        provide the services we need with fewer resources and \n        emissions. Over the past several years, the United States has \n        demonstrated that programs and standards to improve the energy \n        efficiency of buildings, appliances and vehicles can cost-\n        effectively cut carbon pollution and lower energy bills, while \n        maintaining significant support from U.S. industry and \n        consumers.''.\n            (24) In its nationally determined contribution, the United \n        States notes that pursuant to Executive Order No. 13693 (2015), \n        the Federal Government has committed to reduce emissions 40 \n        percent below 2005 levels by 2025, and reaffirmed the \n        Department of Defense's goal to procure renewable energy across \n        military installations and operations ``to drive national \n        greenhouse gas reductions and support preparations for the \n        impacts of climate change''.\n            (25) Article 10 of the Paris Agreement states that \n        ``Parties, noting the importance of technology for the \n        implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions under this \n        Agreement and recognizing existing technology deployment and \n        dissemination efforts, shall strengthen cooperative action on \n        technology development and transfer.''.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO ADVANCE THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE \n              UNITED STATES FROM THE PARIS AGREEMENT.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no funds are authorized \nto be appropriated, obligated, or expended to take any action to \nadvance the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement.\n\nSEC. 4. PLAN FOR THE UNITED STATES TO MEET ITS NATIONALLY DETERMINED \n              CONTRIBUTION UNDER THE PARIS AGREEMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the President shall develop and submit to the \nappropriate congressional committees and make available to the public a \nplan for the United States to meet its nationally determined \ncontribution under the Paris Agreement that describes--\n            (1) how the United States will achieve an economy-wide \n        target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 \n        percent below its 2005 level by 2025;\n            (2) how the United States will use the Paris Agreement's \n        transparency provisions to confirm that other parties to the \n        Agreement with major economies are fulfilling their announced \n        contributions to the Agreement;\n            (3) how the United States may use multilateral and \n        bilateral diplomatic tools, in addition to the expert committee \n        established under Article 15 of the Paris Agreement, to \n        encourage and assist other parties to the Agreement to fulfill \n        their announced contributions;\n            (4) how the Paris Agreement's loss and damage provisions \n        would affect infrastructure resiliency in the United States; \n        and\n            (5) how the plan takes into consideration populations, \n        regions, industries, and constituencies that could be affected \n        by nationally determined contribution under the Paris \n        Agreement, and the failure to meet such contribution, including \n        but not limited to--\n                    (A) American jobs, wage, and pay;\n                    (B) the cost of energy, such as electricity and \n                gasoline, for consumers;

Senior Coordinator for Women and Climate Change.\nSec. 202. Briefing and report.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Women in the United States and around the world are the \n        linchpin of families and communities and are often the first to \n        feel the immediate and adverse effects of social, \n        environmental, and economic stresses on their families and \n        communities.\n            (2) The United Nations has recognized, as one of the \n        central organizing principles for its work, that ``no enduring \n        solution to society's most threatening social, economic and \n        political problems can be found without the full participation, \n        and the full empowerment, of the world's women''.\n            (3) The United Nations Development Programme 2013 Human \n        Development Report has found that the number of people living \n        in extreme poverty could increase by up to 3,000,000,000 by \n        2050 unless environmental disasters are averted by coordinated \n        global action.\n            (4) Climate change is already forcing the most vulnerable \n        communities and populations in developing countries to face \n        unprecedented climate stress, including water scarcity and \n        drought, as well as severe weather events and floods, which can \n        lead to reduced agricultural productivity, food insecurity, and \n        increased disease.\n            (5) Climate change exacerbates issues of scarcity and lack \n        of accessibility to primary natural resources, forest \n        resources, and arable land for food production, thereby \n        contributing to increased conflict and instability, as well as \n        the workload and stresses on women farmers, who are estimated \n        to produce 60 to 80 percent of the food in most developing \n        countries.\n            (6) Women will disproportionately face harmful impacts from \n        climate change, particularly in poor and developing nations \n        where women regularly assume increased responsibility for \n        growing the family's food and collecting water, fuel, and other \n        resources.\n            (7) Epidemics, such as malaria and zika, are expected to \n        worsen and spread due to variations in climate, putting women \n        (especially pregnant mothers and women who hope to become \n        pregnant) and children without access to prevention and medical \n        services at risk.\n            (8) The direct and indirect effects of climate change have \n        a disproportionate impact on marginalized women, such as \n        environmental refugees and displaced persons, migrants, \n        religious, racial, or ethnic minorities, adolescent girls, \n        lesbian and trans women, women living in poverty, and women and \n        girls with disabilities and those who are living with HIV.\n            (9) Conflict has a disproportionate impact on the most \n        vulnerable communities and populations, including women, and is \n        fueled in the poorest regions of the world by harsher climates, \n        leading to migration, refugee crises, and conflicts over scarce \n        natural resources, including land and water.\n            (10) Displaced, refugee, and stateless women and girls face \n        extreme violence and threats, including--\n                    (A) being forced to exchange sex for food and \n                humanitarian supplies;\n                    (B) being at increased risk of rape, sexual \n                exploitation, and abuse; and\n                    (C) being at increased risk for HIV, sexually \n                transmitted infections (STIs), unplanned pregnancy, and \n                poor reproductive health.\n            (11) It is predicted that climate change will lead to \n        increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather \n        conditions, precipitating the occurrence of natural disasters \n        around the globe.\n            (12) The relocation and death of women, and especially \n        mothers, as a result of climate-related disasters often has \n        devastating impacts on social support networks, family ties, \n        and the coping capacity of families and communities.\n            (13) The ability of women to adapt to climate change is \n        constrained by a lack of economic freedoms, property and \n        inheritance rights, and access to financial resources, \n        education, family planning and reproductive health, and new \n        tools, equipment, and technology.\n            (14) Despite having a unique capacity and knowledge to \n        promote and provide for adaptation to climate change, women \n        often have insufficient resources to undertake such adaptation.\n            (15) Women are shown to have a multiplier effect because \n        women use their income and resources, when given the necessary \n        tools, to increase the well-being of their children and \n        families, and thus play a critical role in reducing food \n        insecurity, poverty, and socioeconomic effects of climate \n        change.\n            (16) Women are often underrepresented in the development \n        and formulation of policy regarding mitigation and adaptation \n        to climate change, even though women are often in the best \n        position to provide and consult on adaptive strategies.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions \n        continue to rise.\n            (2) The warming of our planet has led to more frequent, \n        dangerous and expensive extreme weather events, including heat \n        waves, storms, fires, droughts, floods and tornadoes.\n            (3) A 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n        Change (IPCC) recommends that serious efforts be made to limit \n        global warming to 1.5\u000fC, which would require that \n        CO&lt;INF&gt;2&lt;/INF&gt; emissions fall by 45 percent below 2010 levels \n        by 2030, which would be equivalent to approximately 50 percent \n        below 2005 levels by 2030.\n            (4) The atmosphere is a common resource that belongs \n        equally to all.\n            (5) Stabilizing the climate can and must be done in a way \n        that supports vibrant economic growth and a thriving middle \n        class.\n            (6) Legislation to address climate change and accelerate \n        the transition to a clean energy economy must be fair, \n        transparent and built to last.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Security Intelligence Act of \n2019''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The evidence for human-induced climate change is clear \n        and undeniable.\n            (2) According to the 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment of \n        the U.S. Intelligence Community, climate change will fuel \n        competition for resources, and cause economic distress and \n        social discontent through 2019 and beyond.\n            (3) In 2016, the National Intelligence Council found that \n        ``climate change and its resulting effects are likely to pose \n        wide-ranging national security challenges for the United States \n        and other countries over the next 20 years.''.\n            (4) The intelligence community, the Department of Defense, \n        the Department of State, international organizations, and \n        national security experts have all concluded that the impacts \n        of climate change pose a significant risk to the national \n        security of the United States.\n            (5) The impacts of climate change--\n                    (A) threaten the national security infrastructure \n                of the United States both domestically and abroad;\n                    (B) negatively impact the readiness and operations \n                of the Armed Forces; and\n                    (C) contribute to the conditions that lead to \n                subnational, national, regional, and global \n                instability.\n            (6) The intelligence community has previously analyzed, \n        studied, and engaged in public-private partnerships to improve \n        understanding about the effects of climate change on national \n        security, however, such efforts were undertaken in a sporadic \n        manner due to inconsistent policy commitment to such efforts.\n            (7) The United States needs to be fully prepared to respond \n        to the threats to and harmful impacts on national security from \n        climate change, but is not at the present time.\n\nSEC. 3. CLIMATE SECURITY INTELLIGENCE CENTER.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--Title I of the National Security Act of 1947 \n(50 U.S.C. 3021 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following \nnew section:\n\n``SEC. 120.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The United States has the objective of stabilizing \n        greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that \n        would prevent ``dangerous anthropogenic interference'' with the \n        climate system as demonstrated by becoming a party to the 1992 \n        United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, pledging \n        to China to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 28 percent of \n        their 2005 levels by 2025, and regulating greenhouse gas \n        emissions from stationary sources, mobile sources, and \n        electrical power suppliers.\n            (2) To achieve this objective, the increase in global mean \n        surface temperature should not exceed 2\u000fC (3.6\u000fF) above \n        preindustrial temperature by 2100 consistent with the Paris \n        Agreement that entered into force in 2016.\n            (3) The risks associated with a temperature increase above \n        2\u000fC (3.6\u000fF) are grave, including the disintegration of the \n        Greenland ice sheet, which, if it were to melt completely, \n        would raise global average sea level by approximately 23 feet, \n        devastating many of the world's coastal areas and population \n        centers.\n            (4) A 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n        Change demonstrated that limiting the temperature increase to \n        1.5\u000fC will result in still harmful, but significantly less \n        severe outcomes than a 2\u000fC increase.\n            (5) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects \n        that temperatures will rise 1.5\u000fC between 2030 and 2052. In \n        order to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u000fC, global net \n        anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions must reach net zero by \n        2050.\n            (6) The 2018 National Climate Assessment, authored by more \n        than 300 experts and released by the United States Global \n        Change Research Program, makes clear that the present \n        unprecedented rises in global temperature are primarily due to \n        human activities. The changing climate will devastate all \n        sectors of society and disproportionately harm the most \n        vulnerable communities.\n            (7) Serious global warming impacts have already been \n        observed in the United States and worldwide, including--\n                    (A) increases in heat waves and other extreme \n                weather events;\n                    (B) rise in sea level, retreat of glaciers and \n                polar ice;\n                    (C) decline in mountain snowpack, increased drought \n                (including droughts in the West and South United \n                States) resulting in damage to our economy and \n                property;\n                    (D) extreme weather conditions resulting in \n                wildfires, stronger hurricanes, and polar vortex \n                occurrences resulting in further damage to property and \n                our economy;\n                    (E) damage to our environment such as ocean \n                acidification, extensive coral bleaching, migrations, \n                and shifts in the yearly cycles of plants and animals; \n                and\n                    (F) effects on human population, including \n                population displacement and adverse health effects such \n                as the spread of infectious diseases and climate-\n                related conditions such as asthma.\n            (8) Scientists project that under a midrange estimate of \n        global warming, by 2050, roughly 25 percent of animal and plant \n        species will be committed to extinction.\n            (9) After remaining steady from 2014 to 2016, global carbon \n        dioxide emissions increased 1.6 percent in 2017.\n            (10) Decisive action is needed to minimize the many dangers \n        posed by global warming.\n            (11) The timing of such action is critical, given that \n        greenhouse gases can persist in the atmosphere for more than a \n        century.\n            (12) With less than 5 percent of the world population, the \n        United States emits approximately 15 percent of the world's \n        total greenhouse gas emissions and must be a leader in \n        addressing global warming.\n            (13) The State of California, the 5th largest economy in \n        the world, has shown that renewable energy standards and \n        greenhouse gas emissions regulation can reduce greenhouse gas \n        emissions while fostering significant economic growth.\n            (14) Existing energy efficiency and clean, renewable energy \n        technologies can reduce global warming pollution, while saving \n        consumers money, reducing our dependence on oil, enhancing \n        national security, cleaning the air, and protecting pristine \n        places from drilling and mining.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the \nUnited States should participate in negotiations under the 1992 United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change and honor its \ncommitments therefrom with the objective of securing and continuing \nUnited States participation in agreements, including the Paris \nAgreement that the United States accepted on September 3, 2016, and \ntook effect on November 4, 2016, that--\n            (1) establish mitigation commitments by all countries that \n        are major emitters of greenhouse gases, consistent with the \n        principle of common but differentiated responsibilities;\n            (2) achieve reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions \n        at a pace and level sufficient to avoid dangerous interference \n        with the Earth's climate; and\n            (3) advance and protect the economic and national security \n        interests of the United States.\n\n                       TITLE I--RENEWABLE ENERGY\n\nSEC. 101.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) continued inaction in addressing climate change poses a \n        significant and increasing threat to the growth and stability \n        of the economy of the United States;\n            (2) many sectors of the economy of the United States and \n        many American businesses are exposed to multiple channels of \n        climate-related risk, which may include exposure to--\n                    (A) the physical impacts of climate change, \n                including the rise of the average global temperature, \n                accelerating sea-level rise, desertification, ocean \n                acidification, intensification of storms, increase in \n                heavy precipitation, more frequent and intense \n                temperature extremes, more severe droughts, and longer \n                wildfire seasons;\n                    (B) the economic disruptions and security threats \n                that result from the physical impacts described in \n                subparagraph (A); and\n                    (C) the transition impacts that result as the \n                global economy transitions to a clean and renewable \n                energy, low-emissions economy, including financial \n                impacts as fossil fuel assets risk becoming stranded \n                and it becomes uneconomic for companies to develop \n                fossil fuel assets as policymakers act to limit the \n                worst impacts of climate change by keeping the average \n                rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above \n                pre-industrial levels;\n            (3) assessing the potential impact of climate-related risks \n        on national and international financial systems is an urgent \n        concern;\n            (4) companies have a duty to disclose financial risks that \n        climate change presents to their investors, lenders, and \n        insurers;\n            (5) the Commission has a duty to promote a risk-informed \n        securities market that is worthy of the trust of the public as \n        families invest for their futures;\n            (6) investors, lenders, and insurers are increasingly \n        demanding climate risk information that is consistent, \n        comparable, reliable, and clear;\n            (7) including standardized, material climate change risk \n        and opportunity disclosure that is useful for decision makers \n        in annual reports to the Commission will increase transparency \n        with respect to risk accumulation and exposure in financial \n        markets;\n            (8) requiring companies to disclose climate-related risk \n        exposure and risk management strategies will encourage a \n        smoother transition to a clean and renewable energy, low-\n        emissions economy and guide capital allocation to mitigate, and \n        adapt to, the effects of climate change and limit damages \n        associated with climate-related events and disasters; and\n            (9) a critical component in fighting climate change is a \n        transparent accounting of the risks that climate change \n        presents and the implications of continued inaction with \n        respect to climate change.\n\nSEC. 4. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) short-, medium-, and long-term financial and economic \n        risks and opportunities relating to climate change, and the \n        national and global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, \n        constitute information that issuers--\n                    (A) may reasonably expect to affect shareholder \n                decision making; and\n                    (B) should regularly identify, evaluate, and \n                disclose; and\n            (2) the disclosure of information described in paragraph \n        (1) should--\n                    (A) identify, and evaluate--\n                            (i) material physical and transition risks \n                        posed by climate change; and\n                            (ii) the potential financial impact of such \n                        risks;\n                    (B) detail any implications such risks have on \n                corporate strategy;\n                    (C) detail any board-level oversight of material \n                climate-related risks and opportunities;\n                    (D) allow for intra- and cross-industry comparison, \n                to the extent practicable, of climate-related risk \n                exposure through the inclusion of standardized \n                industry-specific and sector-specific disclosure \n                metrics, as identified by the Commission, in \n                consultation with the appropriate climate principals;\n                    (E) allow for tracking of performance over time \n                with respect to mitigating climate risk exposure; and\n                    (F) incorporate a price on greenhouse gas emissions \n                in financial analyses that reflects, at minimum, the \n                social cost of carbon that is attributable to issuers.\n\nSEC. 5.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n        Change, the Earth's climate is now changing faster than at any \n        point in history.\n            (2) The October 2018 report entitled ``Special Report on \n        Global Warming of 1.5\u000f C'' by the Intergovernmental Panel on \n        Climate Change and the November 2018 Fourth National Climate \n        Assessment report found that a changing climate is--\n                    (A) causing sea levels to rise;\n                    (B) contributing to an increase in wildfires and \n                temperature extremes in some parts of the world; and\n                    (C) contributing to an increase in heavy \n                precipitation in certain locations.\n            (3) Forced displacement and forced migration are increasing \n        in the context of environmental changes and climate-induced \n        disruptions, including weather-related disasters, drought, \n        famine, and rising sea levels.\n            (4) Climate-related events and disasters are causing a \n        person to be displaced from his or her home every second.\n            (5) The United Nations Human Rights Council has recognized \n        that climate change poses an existential threat that has \n        already had a negative impact on the fulfilment of human \n        rights, specifically noting that--\n                    (A) parties should, when taking action to address \n                climate change, respect, promote, and consider their \n                respective obligations on human rights; and\n                    (B) the adverse effects of climate change are felt \n                most acutely by those segments of the population that \n                are already in vulnerable situations owing to factors \n                such as geography, poverty, gender, age, indigenous or \n                minority status, national or social origin, birth, or \n                other status and disability.\n            (6) The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for \n        Human Rights has suggested that a person who cannot be \n        reasonably expected to return to his or her country of origin--\n                    (A) should be considered a victim of forced \n                displacement; and\n                    (B) should be granted at least a temporary stay in \n                the country where they have found refuge.\n            (7) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change affirms \n        with high confidence that societal adaptations in the near term \n        can help reduce the risks of climate change throughout the 21st \n        century.\n            (8) Since 2013, typhoons and storms in the Philippines have \n        displaced nearly 15,000,000 people.\n            (9) Violence in Burma's Rakhine State has forced nearly \n        1,000,000 Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh, where they are \n        exposed to the country's vulnerability to the effects of \n        extreme flooding and landslides worsened by climate change.\n            (10) In 2019, extreme flooding in Northern and Northeast \n        India displaced at least 3,000,000 people, including almost \n        2,000,000 people in the Northern Indian state of Bihar and more \n        than 1,700,000 people in Northeastern Assam state.\n            (11) The small Pacific island Nation of Kiribati is \n        preparing for large swaths of the country to be uninhabitable \n        and for its people to migrate with the skill to integrate into \n        their new host nation.\n            (12) More than 150,000,000 people around the world now live \n        on land that will be below sea level or regular flood levels by \n        the end of the century unless adaptation measures are taken.\n            (13) The effects of climate change also exacerbate social, \n        economic, and political tensions within and among nations.\n            (14) In 2014, the Department of Defense Quadrennial Defense \n        Review cited the effects of climate change as a ``threat \n        multiplier'' that could aggravate stressors abroad.\n            (15) In 2016, a memorandum from the National Intelligence \n        Counsel entitled ``Implications for U.S. National Security of \n        Anticipated Climate Change'' highlighted how climate change \n        could create or inflame tensions between nations in already \n        disputed regions, such as the Arctic.\n            (16) Continued climate change will drive further \n        displacement.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``FEMA Climate Change Preparedness \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Under the previous administration, FEMA's 2014-2018 \n        Strategic Plan explicitly mentioned and referenced climate \n        change as a source of changing and increasing national disaster \n        risks, in the near and long term, that--\n                    (A) must be effectively integrated into the \n                Agency's risk assessment resources and processes; and\n                    (B) the entire emergency management community will \n                need to adapt appropriately to as they strengthen their \n                risk management programs.\n            (2) In FEMA's 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, despite the \n        mounting threat posed by climate change, the term ``climate \n        change'' is entirely absent from the text.\n            (3) It is the general consensus of the global scientific \n        community that--\n                    (A) the evidence of climate change is unequivocal;\n                    (B) anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the \n                primary cause of climate change; and\n                    (C) as a direct result of climate change, sea \n                levels are rising and extreme weather events are \n                becoming more commonplace and severe.\n            (4) The last 5 years have been the warmest years on record \n        since the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began \n        recording global air temperatures in 1895.\n            (5) 2017, one of the three warmest years on record, was \n        also the most expensive year on record for emergency disaster \n        costs in the United States due to 16 weather and climate \n        disasters.\n            (6) It is the mission of FEMA to reduce the loss of life \n        and property and protect our institutions from all hazards by \n        leading and supporting the Nation in a comprehensive, risk-\n        based emergency management program of mitigation, preparedness, \n        response, and recovery.\n            (7) It is detrimental to the mission of FEMA, and the \n        Agency's ability to follow its mandate, to explicitly or \n        implicitly deny or ignore the existence of climate change or \n        the implications of such on national security and national \n        emergency management.\n            (8) To fully and effectively carry out its mandate, FEMA \n        must comprehensively assess and incorporate the current and \n        future natural disaster risks and impacts posed by climate \n        change throughout the Agency's policies, plans, programs, \n        strategies, and operations.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Green Climate Fund Authorization Act \nof 2019''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) climate change most severely impacts vulnerable and \n        disadvantaged communities in the United States and around the \n        world;\n            (2) it is the responsibility of the United States \n        Government to work with its global partners to promote \n        environmental justice and climate justice;\n            (3) the report of the United Nations Environment Programme \n        entitled ``Climate Change and the Cost of Capital in Developing \n        Countries'', dated May 2018, found that, in the 10 years prior \n        to the publication of the report, climate vulnerability has \n        cost the 20 nations most affected by catastrophes rooted in \n        climate change an additional $62,000,000,000 in interest \n        payments alone;\n            (4) individuals and families, particularly communities of \n        color, indigenous communities, and low-income communities, that \n        are on the frontlines of climate change across the globe are \n        often in close proximity to environmental stressors or sources \n        of pollution;\n            (5) the communities described in paragraph (4)--\n                    (A) are often the first exposed to the causes and \n                impacts of climate change; and\n                    (B) have the fewest resources with which to \n                mitigate those impacts or to relocate;\n            (6) all efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change \n        must include specific protections for and acknowledgment of the \n        harm of climate change to communities of color, indigenous \n        peoples, women, and other frontline communities and \n        marginalized peoples around the world;\n            (7) in Paris, on December 12, 2015, the parties to the \n        United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted \n        the Paris Agreement, a benchmark agreement--\n                    (A) to combat climate change; and\n                    (B) to accelerate and intensify the actions and \n                investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future;\n            (8) the Paris Agreement, to which the United States is a \n        party, acknowledges, ``Parties should, when taking action to \n        address climate change, respect, promote and consider their \n        respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, \n        the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, \n        children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable \n        situations and the right to development, as well as gender \n        equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity'';\n            (9) the Paris Agreement--\n                    (A) notes the importance of ``climate justice'' \n                when mitigating and adapting to climate change; and\n                    (B) recognizes ``the need for an effective and \n                progressive response to the urgent threat of climate \n                change'';\n            (10) it is imperative for all countries to undertake \n        mitigation activities to rapidly meet the goal of limiting \n        global warming to not more than 1.5 degrees Celsius;\n            (11) developed countries have the greatest capacity to \n        mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions, while--\n                    (A) developing countries have the least capacity to \n                engage in mitigation activities; and\n                    (B) the capacity of developing countries to engage \n                in mitigation activities is less than the national \n                mitigation potential of those developing countries;\n            (12) the determination for the fair share of mitigation and \n        adaptation activities for each country must take into account--\n                    (A) the historic greenhouse gas emissions of each \n                country; and\n                    (B) the current capacity of each country to both \n                mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate \n                impacts;\n            (13) developed countries that have historically emitted a \n        disproportionately high share of greenhouse gas emissions, and \n        reaped the economic benefits of those polluting activities, \n        have a corresponding disproportionately greater responsibility \n        to engage in global mitigation and adaptation activities, as \n        compared to less industrialized countries that have \n        historically polluted far less;\n            (14) the only realistic way for less industrialized \n        countries to meet their full mitigation potential is through \n        international climate financing by more developed countries;\n            (15) in the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, developed countries \n        committed to jointly mobilize, starting in 2020, \n        $100,000,000,000 per year in public climate financing (as well \n        as private investment and other alternative forms of finance), \n        for developing countries, a commitment reaffirmed in 2015 in \n        Decision 1/CP.21 of the United Nations Framework Convention on \n        Climate Change, Adoption of the Paris Agreement;\n            (16) the $100,000,000,000 commitment described in paragraph \n        (15) was a political compromise that falls short of the actual \n        financing needs for climate action in developing countries;\n            (17) Bloomberg New Energy Finance has estimated that the \n        transition to renewable energy sources in developing countries \n        will require hundreds of billions of dollars annually;\n            (18) the United Nations Environment Programme has estimated \n        that adaptation needs relating to climate change in developing \n        countries may be as much as $300,000,000,000 annually by 2030;\n            (19) the Green Climate Fund was created in 2010 by 194 \n        countries to serve as a crucial financing mechanism to help \n        developing countries limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions \n        and adapt to climate change;\n            (20) in 2015, the United Nations Framework Convention on \n        Climate Change agreed that the Green Climate Fund should serve \n        the goals of the Paris Agreement, which states that ``developed \n        country Parties shall provide financial resources to assist \n        developing country Parties with respect to both mitigation and \n        adaptation in continuation of their existing obligations under \n        the Convention'';\n            (21) the Green Climate Fund is an essential institution for \n        climate financing, as the Green Climate Fund ensures--\n                    (A) balanced governance between developed and \n                developing countries;\n                    (B) stakeholder engagement and discourse;\n                    (C) a balanced approach between mitigation and \n                adaptation;\n                    (D) fair and equal labor and working conditions;\n                    (E) conservation of biodiversity and critical \n                habitats; and\n                    (F) strong environmental, social, and gender \n                protections;\n            (22) the Green Climate Fund--\n                    (A) promotes and protects human rights and the \n                rights of marginalized groups, including indigenous \n                peoples, women, children, and people with disabilities; \n                and\n                    (B) continues to take steps to strengthen \n                protection for marginalized groups;\n            (23) the United States committed $3,000,000,000 of the \n        first $10,000,000,000 raised for the initial resource \n        mobilization period of the Green Climate Fund, though only \\1/\n        3\\ of this pledge was fulfilled, leaving the United States the \n        only country to fall substantially short of a commitment of a \n        country to the Green Climate Fund; and\n            (24) the Green Climate Fund is a fully operational and \n        proven institution supporting well over 100 projects and \n        programs in developing countries around the world.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to provide climate \nfinancing--\n            (1) as an essential part of the global effort to combat \n        climate change; and\n            (2) that--\n                    (A) upholds the principles of environmental justice \n                and climate justice;\n                    (B) supports programs and projects developed by \n                recipient countries and communities;\n                    (C) is designed and implemented with the free, \n                prior, and informed consent of indigenous peoples and \n                other impacted communities;\n                    (D) promotes gender equality as essential in all of \n                the projects and programs supported by climate \n                financing;\n                    (E) includes best practices for environmental and \n                social safeguards to ensure that projects and programs \n                supported by climate financing respect fundamental \n                human rights; and\n                    (F) addresses both mitigation and adaptation as \n                essential aspects of responding to climate change.\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated for fiscal \nyear 2020 and each fiscal year thereafter such sums as may be necessary \nfor contributions to the Green Climate Fund--\n            (1) to achieve the greenhouse gas emissions reductions \n        required to keep the planet at or below 1.5 degrees Celsius of \n        global warming, consistent with the goals of the Paris \n        Agreement; and\n            (2) to exceed the commitment by developed countries to \n        jointly mobilize, starting in 2020, $100,000,000,000 for \n        climate financing each year, as committed to in the 2009 \n        Copenhagen Accord and reaffirmed in 2015 in Decision 1/CP.21 of \n        the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \n        Adoption of the Paris Agreement.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that climate \nfinancing needs are significantly greater than those described in \nsubsection (a)(2).\n\nSEC. 5.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Resiliency Service Corps Act \nof 2019''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Every region of the United States is confronting the \n        effects of climate change and related natural disasters, \n        including extreme heat and droughts, heavy rains and flooding, \n        hurricanes and tornadoes, acidification of the oceans and sea \n        level rise, wildfires, and mudslides, among other effects.\n            (2) These changes affect the health, agriculture, food \n        supply, infrastructure, energy supply, water quality and water \n        supply, and have the potential to reduce the standard of living \n        and quality of life in the United States.\n            (3) The Fourth National Climate Assessment estimates that \n        low-income communities will be disproportionately impacted by \n        climate change through higher rates of adverse health \n        conditions, greater exposure to environmental hazards, and more \n        severe impacts and longer recovery from natural disasters.\n            (4) The Fourth National Climate Assessment estimates that--\n                    (A) climate change will shrink the American economy \n                by up to 10 percent by the year 2100 and will result in \n                losses up to $141,000,000,000 from heat-related deaths, \n                $118,000,000,000 from sea level rise, and \n                $32,000,000,000 from infrastructure damage; and\n                    (B) proactive adaptation initiatives yield benefits \n                in excess of their costs in both the near term and long \n                term.\n            (5) The frequency and severity of natural disasters taking \n        place each year is steadily and significantly increasing. In \n        1970, there were 78 registered natural disasters. In 2017, \n        there were 335 natural disasters, impacting approximately \n        96,000,000 people and costing the United States more than \n        $306,000,000,000.\n            (6) Service and Conservation Corps, which are descended \n        from the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s, are trained \n        for and have experience with the four stages of disaster: \n        mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Change Financial Risk Act of \n2019''.\n\nSEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) if current trends continue, average global temperatures \n        are likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial \n        levels between 2030 and 2050;\n            (2) global temperature rise has already resulted in an \n        increased number of heavy rainstorms, coastal flooding events, \n        heat waves, wildfires, and other extreme events;\n            (3) since 1980--\n                    (A) the number of extreme weather events per year \n                that cost the people of the United States more than \n                $1,000,000,000 per event, accounting for inflation, has \n                increased significantly; and\n                    (B) the total cost of extreme weather events in the \n                United States has exceeded $1,100,000,000,000;\n            (4) as physical impacts from climate change are manifested \n        across multiple sectors of the economy of the United States--\n                    (A) climate-related economic risks will continue to \n                increase;\n                    (B) climate-related extreme weather events will \n                disrupt energy and transportation systems in the United \n                States, which will result in more frequent and longer-\n                lasting power outages, fuel shortages, and service \n                disruptions in critical sectors across the economy of \n                the United States;\n                    (C) projected increases in extreme heat conditions \n                will lead to decreases in labor productivity in \n                agriculture, construction, and other critical economic \n                sectors;\n                    (D) food and livestock production will be impacted \n                in regions that experience increases in heat and \n                drought and small rural communities will struggle to \n                find the resources needed to adapt to those changes; \n                and\n                    (E) sea level rise and more frequent and intense \n                extreme weather events will--\n                            (i) increasingly disrupt and damage private \n                        property and critical infrastructure; and\n                            (ii) drastically increase insured and \n                        uninsured losses;\n            (5) advances in energy efficiency and renewable energy \n        technologies, as well as climate policies and shifting societal \n        preferences, will--\n                    (A) reduce global demand for fossil fuels; and\n                    (B) expose transition risks for fossil fuel \n                companies and investors, which could include trillions \n                of dollars of stranded assets around the world;\n            (6) climate change poses uniquely far-reaching risks to the \n        financial services industry, including with respect to \n        underwriting, credit, and market risks, due to the number of \n        sectors and locations impacted and the potentially irreversible \n        scale of damage;\n            (7) financial institutions must take a consistent approach \n        to assessing climate-related financial risks and incorporating \n        those risks into existing risk management practices, which \n        should be informed by scenario analysis;\n            (8) the Board of Governors conducts annual assessments of \n        the capital adequacy and capital planning practices of the \n        largest and most complex banking organizations (referred to in \n        this section as ``stress tests'') in order to promote a safe, \n        sound, and efficient banking and financial system;\n            (9) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the stress \n        tests conducted by the Board of Governors are not designed to \n        reflect the physical risks or transition risks posed by climate \n        change; and\n            (10) the Board of Governors--\n                    (A) has the authority to take into account the \n                potentially systemic impact of climate-related risks on \n                the financial system; and\n                    (B) should develop new analytical tools with longer \n                time horizons to accurately assess and manage the risks \n                described in subparagraph (A).\n\nSEC. 3.

PUBLIC LANDS ENERGY AND CLIMATE POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States that--\n            (1) the United States should aggressively reduce greenhouse \n        gas emissions from United States public lands and oceans and \n        strive to achieve net-zero emissions as soon as possible;\n            (2) public lands should be managed to reduce greenhouse gas \n        emissions and co-pollutant emissions and to respond to \n        unavoidable impacts of climate change through increased \n        resilience of ecosystems and wildlife habitats in accordance \n        with the principles of multiple use and sustained yield;\n            (3) the protection of ocean ecosystems is vital to \n        promoting ocean health and increasing resilience to climate \n        change, and conservation of United States marine resources is \n        one of the best ways to remove carbon dioxide from the \n        atmosphere;\n            (4) energy development decisions on public lands and oceans \n        should be guided by the goals of--\n                    (A) protecting human well-being, biodiversity, and \n                the environment;\n                    (B) avoiding the most harmful impacts of climate \n                change; and\n                    (C) promoting a rapid, sustainable, just, and \n                equitable transition to a clean energy economy; and\n            (5) environmental justice communities are more vulnerable \n        to the effects of emissions from public lands and oceans and \n        often have the least resources to respond; thus, they should be \n        meaningfully engaged in government decision making as our \n        Nation reduces emissions from public lands and oceans and \n        builds its climate resilience against the effects of those \n        emissions.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Atmospheric Climate Intervention \nResearch Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n        (referred to in this section as ``NOAA'') and its Office of \n        Ocean and Atmospheric Research undertakes research, including \n        scientific research, computer modeling and other forms of \n        analysis, and uses satellite, airborne, and ground-based \n        systems to monitor atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, \n        including radiative forcing gases and stratospheric ozone as \n        well as the chemical compounds and atmospheric conditions that \n        affect its concentration.\n            (2) The NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory, the NOAA \n        Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, and the NOAA Air \n        Resource Laboratory are actively involved in observations, \n        modeling, and monitoring that enhance the scientific \n        understanding of atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, drivers of \n        radiative forcing of climate change in the atmosphere, the \n        health of the stratosphere, including ozone and the processes \n        affecting its concentration in the stratosphere, and cloud \n        aerosol interactions and their climate effects.\n            (3) There are significant risks posed by the potential \n        introduction of material into the stratosphere from natural \n        events such as volcanic eruptions, increased air and space \n        traffic, and proposals to inject material to temporarily reduce \n        global radiative forcing of climate that currently are the \n        subject of a forthcoming report by the National Academies of \n        Sciences.\n            (4) To monitor and assess these risks requires significant \n        improvements to observations of the abundances and chemistry of \n        the stratospheric gases and particles and the reflectivity of \n        the stratosphere to establish the baseline state of the \n        stratosphere and its trend over time and to develop \n        enhancements to stratospheric models used for predicting \n        climate impacts of material introduced into the stratosphere by \n        natural or other means.\n            (5) Under the Weather Modification Reporting Act of 1972 \n        (15 U.S.C. 330 et seq.), NOAA is responsible for oversight of \n        any activities undertaken to modify weather, which includes \n        research or testing activities related to modifying the \n        atmosphere to affect local, regional, or global climate \n        (defined as atmospheric climate intervention under such Act).\n            (6) The Montreal Protocol, finalized in 1987, and ratified \n        by the United States in 1988, has proven to be innovative and \n        successful in protecting the Earth's ozone layer, and is the \n        only environmental treaty to achieve universal ratification by \n        all countries in the world.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Targeting Environmental and Climate \nRecklessness Act of 2019''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) There is strong global support for actions that limit \n        the severity of climate change.\n            (2) On September 18, 2019, more than 200 representatives of \n        environmental groups, human rights groups, indigenous peoples, \n        workers, and academia adopted a declaration calling on \n        governments to urgently address environmental damage, including \n        by increasing the pressure on those most responsible for \n        climate change.\n            (3) The United States Government has developed and \n        implements targeted measures to restrict access to the United \n        States financial system for specific individuals and entities \n        involved in conduct including malicious cyber-enabled activity, \n        transnational organized crime, narcotics trafficking, \n        terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, human \n        rights abuse, and corruption. Those conduct-based measures \n        apply globally and are not focused on any specific country.\n            (4) As of the date of the enactment of this Act, the United \n        States Government seeks to apply existing sanctions authorities \n        against individuals and entities engaged in wildlife \n        trafficking. On January 30, 2018, the Office of Foreign Assets \n        Control designated an organization for engaging in illicit \n        activities including the trafficking of endangered and \n        vulnerable animals such as black bears, pangolins, tigers, \n        rhinoceroses, and elephants.\n            (5) Climate change has disproportionate impact on poorer \n        communities and individuals in less developed countries. \n        Targeted measures against individuals and entities most \n        responsible for exacerbating climate change could help ensure \n        that efforts to address climate change do not worsen global \n        inequality.\n            (6) Development of carbon-intensive electrical power plants \n        is continuing across the developing world through new foreign \n        investments, despite broad awareness of the dangers.\n            (7) The current investment plans of countries likely to \n        receive significant foreign energy investments may lead to an \n        excess build-out of fossil fuel assets and create carbon \n        ``lock-in'' absent urgent action.\n            (8) Governments that are investing in or directing foreign \n        investment toward legacy fossil fuel energy generation often \n        lack the incentive to formulate more efficient or sustainable \n        national energy policies. Those governments are thus likely to \n        default to established but harmful forms of energy generation.\n            (9) Alternatives to carbon-intensive electrical power \n        generation are now available and technological advancements \n        continue to strengthen the economic competitiveness of such \n        alternatives.\n            (10) Corruption is especially harmful when individuals who \n        abuse positions of influence for personal gain can \n        simultaneously cause great damage to the global commons by \n        facilitating significant increases in the emission of, or \n        decreases in the absorption of, greenhouse gases.\n            (11) Deforestation is doubly damaging because it undercuts \n        the absorption of carbon dioxide, while also raising greenhouse \n        gas emissions.\n            (12) According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n        Change, most pathways to limit warming to well below 2 degrees \n        Celsius require reduced deforestation in concert with \n        reforestation, afforestation, and bioenergy efforts.\n            (13) From 2013 to 2019, some of the largest financial \n        institutions in the world provided tens of billions of dollars \n        in financing to entities either directly or indirectly \n        deforesting the largest rainforests in the world. Most \n        financial institutions have no internal policy covering \n        dealings in key forest-risk commodities.\n            (14) On September 22, 2019, 130 financial institutions \n        worth $47,000,000,000,000 collectively, representing \\1/3\\ of \n        the global industry, signed on to the United Nations-backed \n        Principles for Responsible Banking, committing to strategically \n        align their businesses with the goals of the agreement of the \n        parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \n        Change, done at Paris December 12, 2015, and entered into force \n        November 4, 2016 (in this Act referred to as the ``Paris \n        Climate Agreement''), and the Sustainable Development Goals \n        adopted by all United Nations member countries in 2015.\n            (15) Illegal deforestation causes environmental harm while \n        promoting criminal activity. In the Brazilian Amazon, criminal \n        networks with the capacity to coordinate large-scale \n        extraction, processing, and sale of timber deploy armed \n        personnel to protect their interests. They regularly kill and \n        threaten people who stand in the way of criminal activity, \n        including members of indigenous communities and environmental \n        enforcement officials. Perpetrators of violence are rarely \n        brought to justice.\n            (16) Between 2002 and 2017, 1,558 people in 50 countries \n        were killed for defending their environments and lands. \n        Environmental defenders currently face a wave of violence that \n        includes threats of physical harm, intimidation, and \n        criminalization.\n            (17) Policies and measures to address climate change must \n        also promote human rights, thereby advancing equality, justice, \n        and dignity for all, in line with the Sustainable Development \n        Goals of the United Nations.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING \n              CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the restrictive measures described in this Act are only \n        one component of the comprehensive approach needed to address \n        climate change and mitigate its effects;\n            (2) the United States Government must ensure through law \n        and regulation that United States entities are not engaged in \n        any of the egregious behaviors for which foreign persons may be \n        targeted under this Act;\n            (3) the United States Government must recommit to the Paris \n        Climate Agreement and commit to any successor agreement;\n            (4) the United States Government must fulfill its pledges \n        to the Green Climate Fund and promote international efforts to \n        support climate change adaptation and mitigation;\n            (5) the United States Government must work proactively with \n        foreign governments, including by offering positive incentives, \n        to address climate change and to promote economic development \n        in ways that do not needlessly increase carbon emissions or \n        increase the risk of corruption;\n            (6) the restrictive measures described in this Act should \n        be employed if engagement has failed to prevent significant \n        actions that exacerbate climate change; and\n            (7) given broad international support for countering \n        climate change, the Secretary of State should encourage the \n        governments of other countries to implement restrictive \n        measures that are similar to the provisions of this Act in \n        order to increase the effectiveness of actions taken by the \n        United States to combat significant actions that exacerbate \n        climate change, including related corruption and human rights \n        violations.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF \n              CHINA.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the United States Government should encourage the \n        People's Republic of China to follow through on its stated \n        intentions to reduce the negative environmental impacts of \n        Chinese foreign investment, including investments provided \n        through the Belt and Road Initiative;\n            (2) the United States Government should negotiate a binding \n        agreement to end fossil fuel subsidies with major economies \n        including the People's Republic of China;\n            (3) the United States Government should build on the \n        successes of existing engagement with the People's Republic of \n        China through the United States-China Clean Energy Research \n        Center and other initiatives to launch new cooperative efforts;\n            (4) the United States Government should engage in expanded \n        dialogue with the People's Republic of China to ensure that \n        development finance institutions do not undermine global \n        decarbonization efforts; and\n            (5) the United States Government should work with the \n        People's Republic of China to develop and adopt safeguards to \n        promote low-carbon, climate-resilient investments over high-\n        carbon, climate risk-inducing investments, particularly in \n        emerging and developing economies in the Indo-Pacific, Africa, \n        and Latin America.\n\nSEC. 5. STATEMENT OF POLICY ON APPLICATION OF GLOBAL MAGNITSKY \n              SANCTIONS TO CLIMATE-LINKED CORRUPTION AND HUMAN RIGHTS \n              ABUSES.\n\n    (a) In General.--It is the policy of the United States to \nconsider--\n            (1) any act of corruption related to a covered activity (as \n        defined in section 6(h)) to be corruption, as that term is used \n        in Executive Order 13818 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note; relating to \n        blocking the property of persons involved in serious human \n        rights abuse or corruption); and\n            (2) any violation of internationally recognized human \n        rights committed against an individual described in subsection \n        (b) to be a serious human rights abuse, as that term is used in \n        that Executive Order 13818.\n    (b) Individuals Described.--An individual described in this \nsubsection is an individual--\n            (1) seeking to protect the environment, public health, or \n        community land rights;\n            (2) seeking to expose, or raise awareness of, environmental \n        damage; or\n            (3) obliged to leave the individual's habitual home due, in \n        whole or in part, to sudden or progressive change in the \n        environment that adversely affects the individual's life or \n        living conditions.\n\nSEC. 6. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS \n              THAT EXACERBATE CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nPresident should employ the authorities provided by this section to \nprioritize action against, and deterrence of, egregious behaviors that \nundermine efforts to limit the increase in global average temperature \nto 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n    (b) In General.--The President may impose one or more of the \nsanctions described in subsection (c) with respect to any foreign \nperson the President determines, based on credible information--\n            (1) to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have \n        directly or indirectly engaged in, a covered activity, \n        including a government official who approves or implements \n        policies or acts that serve to promote a covered activity;\n            (2) to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, \n        directly or indirectly, any foreign person in a matter relating \n        to a covered activity, including for or on behalf of a \n        government official described in paragraph (1);\n            (3) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided \n        financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or \n        services to or in support of, a covered activity;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Prices Require Including \nClimate Externalities Act'' or as the ``Energy PRICE Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to clarify the intent of Congress when \npassing the Federal Power Act and to provide direction to the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission with respect to wholesale electricity \nrates.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) When passing the Federal Power Act, Congress required \n        the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``the Commission'') \n        to ensure that the rates charged by electric utilities for, or \n        in connection with, wholesale electricity rates are ``just and \n        reasonable'', a process which necessarily includes the \n        evaluation of all factors affecting wholesale market rates, \n        including environmental externalities.\n            (2) The Federal Power Act requires the Commission to ensure \n        that public utilities do not grant undue preference or \n        advantage to, or discriminate against, any person when making \n        wholesale electricity sales.\n            (3) Section 206(a) of the Federal Power Act authorizes the \n        Commission to change any rates that the Commission determines \n        to be ``unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or \n        preferential''.\n            (4) In its final rule titled ``Endangerment and Cause or \n        Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) \n        of the Clean Air Act'' published on December 15, 2009 (74 Fed. \n        Reg. 66496), the Environmental Protection Agency found that the \n        emissions of greenhouse gases ``endanger both the public health \n        and the public welfare of current and future generations''.\n            (5) The failure of markets to internalize the costs of \n        greenhouse gas pollution into the cost of products, including \n        electricity, led to a misallocation of capital, and therefore \n        to the emission of a greater volume of these pollutants.\n            (6) In 1956, the Supreme Court held in Federal Power \n        Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Company, 350 U.S. 348 \n        (1956), that the Commission must ensure protection of the \n        public interest when exercising its authority to set just and \n        reasonable rates.\n            (7) The restructuring of the electricity industry in the \n        Federal Power Act was intended to promote competition among \n        electricity providers, resulting in lower electricity rates to \n        consumers, higher quality services, and a more robust national \n        economy.\n            (8) Prior to restructuring, utility commissions were \n        frequently asked to consider other societal benefits when \n        setting rates, including access to energy, rate equity between \n        different classes of customers, and environmental concerns.\n            (9) According to the Environmental Protection Agency, in \n        2017, emissions from the power sector contributed the second \n        highest share of greenhouse gas emissions by economic sector.\n            (10) The benefits of competition will not be achieved if \n        some competitors enjoy an advantage resulting from \n        externalization of environmental costs, permitting them to \n        charge prices for electricity that do not reflect the full \n        economic and environmental cost of production.\n            (11) Despite the Environmental Protection Agency's finding \n        of endangerment, emissions of greenhouse gases into the air, \n        which endanger public health and threaten the quality of the \n        air, land, and water of the United States, are externalities \n        that are not frequently or uniformly reflected in the price \n        charged for products such as electricity across the United \n        States.\n            (12) The disparity in regulatory treatment between electric \n        generating units with above-average greenhouse gas emissions \n        and those with little to no greenhouse gas emissions provides a \n        significant competitive advantage for high greenhouse gas \n        emitting energy generating units over their competitors.\n            (13) States and State commissions should be encouraged to \n        incorporate the cost of greenhouse gas emissions into wholesale \n        rates for electricity.\n\nSEC. 4. CERTAIN RATES UNJUST, UNREASONABLE, UNDULY DISCRIMINATORY, OR \n              PREFERENTIAL.\n\n    (a) In General.--For the purposes of section 205 and section 206 of \nthe Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824d, 824e), if the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission determines that a rate for the wholesale sale of \nelectricity does not incorporate the cost of externalized greenhouse \ngas emissions to public health, safety, or welfare, then the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission shall find that such rate is unjust, \nunreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential.\n    (b) Greenhouse Gas Defined.--In this subsection, the term \n``greenhouse gas'' includes--\n            (1) any gas identified by the Environmental Protection \n        Agency in the final rule titled ``Endangerment and Cause or \n        Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) \n        of the Clean Air Act'' published on December 15, 2009 (74 Fed. \n        Reg. 66496), including carbon dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons, \n        methane, nitrous oxide, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur \n        hexafluoride; and\n            (2) nitrogen trifluoride.\n    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed \nto affect or modify the existing authorities of the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission.\n                                 &lt;all&gt;\n</pre></body></html>\n", "BILLS-116hr5977ih": "<html><body><pre>\n[Congressional Bills 116th Congress]\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\n[H.R. 5977 Introduced in House (IH)]\n\n&lt;DOC&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n116th CONGRESS\n  2d Session\n                                H.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Moving Towards A Safe Climate Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 2018, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on \n        Climate Change released a report that found that global warming \n        could reach 1.5 degrees Celsius above average temperature \n        levels by the year 2030.\n            (2) The report outlined the potential impacts and \n        associated risks of a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees \n        Celsius, including increasing--\n                    (A) intensity and frequency of droughts;\n                    (B) frequency and amount of heavy precipitation; \n                and\n                    (C) other extreme weather events.\n            (3) The report found that in order to avoid the impacts of \n        a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, greenhouse gas \n        emissions must be reduced--\n                    (A) between 40 to 60 percent below the level of \n                greenhouse gas emissions recorded in the year 2010 by \n                the year 2030; and\n                    (B) to net zero emissions by the year 2050.\n            (4) According to a report by the Environmental Protection \n        Agency entitled ``Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions \n        and Sinks'', transportation activities accounted for the \n        largest portion (approximately 29.9 percent) of total \n        greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2017.\n            (5) The Secretary of Transportation has a leading role in \n        reducing United States greenhouse gas emissions since \n        transportation activities continue to account for a large \n        portion of total greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.\n            (6) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions will demonstrate \n        adherence to the commitments of the United States under the \n        Paris Agreement, and any other similar international climate \n        change agreements.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Change and Hurricane \nCorrelation and Strategy Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to reports dated August 24, 2019, President \n        Trump suggested the use of nuclear weapons to disrupt hurricane \n        paths. Specifically, the President stated, ``I got it. I got \n        it. Why don't we nuke them? They start forming off the coast of \n        Africa, as they're moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb \n        inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can't \n        we do that?''.\n            (2) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n        (NOAA), the United States Government agency that monitors and \n        researches weather patterns and changes, stated ``During each \n        hurricane season, there always appear suggestions that one \n        should simply use nuclear weapons to try and destroy the \n        storms. Apart from the fact that this might not even alter the \n        storm, this approach neglects the problem that the released \n        radioactive fallout would fairly quickly move with the \n        tradewinds to affect land areas and cause devastating \n        environmental problems. Needless to say, this is not a good \n        idea.''.\n            (3) Nuclear weapons are the most powerful weapons known to \n        mankind. A nuclear blast radius carries exponentially damaging \n        radioactive fallout, as demonstrated by atmospheric tests \n        conducted by the United States in the 1950s and 1960s in the \n        Pacific and Nevada Test Range.\n            (4) According to the Director of National Intelligence and \n        Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, climate change remains a \n        critical national security threat.\n            (5) Researchers found that if little is done to constrain \n        greenhouse gas emissions, and the world warms by 3\\o\\C to 4\\o\\C \n        this century, then hurricane rainfall could increase by a \n        third, while wind speeds would be boosted by as much as 25 \n        knots.\n            (6) Stronger hurricanes are intensifying more rapidly than \n        they were 30 years ago due to climate change, according to \n        recent research.\n            (7) Increasing numbers of hurricanes are a function of \n        climate change and must be addressed through serious and long-\n        term solutions that include scientific research and \n        technological innovation.\n            (8) There is cause for concern to public health, safety, \n        and national security by the dangerous misuse of nuclear bombs \n        to alter serious weather patterns.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION.\n\n    The Federal Government (including the President and any Federal \nofficial, department, and agency) shall not deploy a strategic weapon, \nsuch as a nuclear bomb, for purposes of altering weather patterns or \naddressing climate change.\n\nSEC. 4.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The ocean and coastal waters of the United States are \n        foundational to the economy, security, global competitiveness, \n        and well-being of the United States and continuously serve the \n        people of the United States and other countries as an important \n        source of food, energy, economic productivity, recreation, \n        culture, beauty, and enjoyment.\n            (2) Over many years, the resource productivity and water \n        quality of the ocean and coastal areas of the United States \n        have been diminished by pollution, increasing population \n        demands, economic development, and natural and man-made hazard \n        events, both acute and chronic.\n            (3) Ocean and coastal areas of the United States are \n        managed by State and Federal resource agencies and regulated on \n        an interstate and regional scale by various overlapping Federal \n        authorities, thereby creating a significant need for interstate \n        coordination to enhance regional priorities, including the \n        ecological and economic health of those areas.\n            (4) Regional Ocean Partnerships, established by coastal \n        states working in close coordination with Federal agencies, \n        regional fisheries managers, and Tribal governments, help \n        coordinate interstate responses to critical ocean issues that \n        extend beyond individual State boundaries.\n            (5) Regional Ocean Partnerships have improved understanding \n        of climate change's impact on fish and shellfish populations, \n        have invested in identifying indicators of ocean health and \n        addressing coastal mitigation, and have played leading roles in \n        the creation and upkeep of regional ocean data portals that \n        allow for improved understanding of ocean use synergies and \n        trade-offs.\n            (6) Regional Ocean Partnerships engage in coordinated \n        efforts to protect and enhance the health of living resources \n        and engage the public in stewardship of ocean and coastal \n        areas.\n            (7) The coordination offered by Regional Ocean Partnerships \n        is particularly critical in the era of climate change, with \n        coastal and ocean resources under threat and as demand for \n        offshore resources increases.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are as follows:\n            (1) To complement and expand cooperative voluntary efforts \n        intended to manage and restore ocean and coastal areas spanning \n        across multiple State boundaries.\n            (2) To expand Federal support for monitoring, data \n        management, and restoration activities in ocean and coastal \n        areas.\n            (3) To commit the United States to a comprehensive \n        cooperative program to achieve improved water quality in, and \n        improvements in the productivity of living resources of, all \n        coastal ecosystems.\n            (4) To authorize Regional Ocean Partnerships as \n        intergovernmental coordinators for shared interstate and \n        regional priorities relating to the collaborative management of \n        the large marine ecosystems, thereby reducing duplication of \n        efforts and maximizing opportunities to leverage support in the \n        ocean and coastal regions.\n            (5) To enable Regional Ocean Partnerships, or designated \n        fiscal management entities of such partnerships, to receive \n        Federal funding to conduct the scientific research, \n        conservation and restoration activities, and priority \n        coordination on shared regional priorities necessary to achieve \n        the purposes described in paragraphs (1) through (4).\n\nSEC. 1202.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The planet risks increasingly catastrophic impacts \n        unless global average temperatures are limited to no more than \n        2\u000fC, aiming for 1.5\u000fC above preindustrial levels.\n            (2) According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n        Change's Special Report on 1.5\u000fC, limiting warming to no more \n        than 1.5\u000fC requires fast mitigation of both CO2 and non-CO2 \n        climate pollutants, as well as the protection and expansion of \n        forests and other sinks that remove and store CO2, along with \n        other strategies for removing CO2 and other climate pollutants.\n            (3) Forced displacement and forced migration are \n        increasingly caused or exacerbated by environmental changes and \n        climate-induced disruptions.\n            (4) The United National Human Rights Council has recognized \n        that climate change poses an existential threat that has \n        already had a negative impact on the fulfillment of human \n        rights.\n            (5) To have a chance at limiting warming to 1.5\u000fC and \n        avoiding increasingly severe impacts from climate change, the \n        Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that \n        global net anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions must fall by \n        45 percent from global 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net-zero \n        by 2050.\n            (6) Failure to act on the climate crisis leads to higher \n        levels of warming and exposes all regions of the world to \n        potentially catastrophic insecurity and destabilization that \n        could cause a breakdown of economies, social systems, and \n        political institutions in ways that are likely irreversible. It \n        is in the interest of the United States to place a high \n        priority on strengthening the global response to the threat of \n        climate change.\n            (7) United States leadership and ingenuity are central to \n        solving the climate crisis. The United States must act \n        urgently, guided by science, and in concert with the \n        international community to significantly reduce emissions, \n        prepare for climate impacts, and drive progress through \n        international negotiations to maintain a livable climate for \n        today and future generations.\n            (8) The United States can also build strong scientific and \n        security partnerships and reinforce the United States ability \n        to lead on other key global priorities through climate \n        diplomacy. These efforts can foster climate security while \n        creating new opportunities for United States leadership, \n        economic growth, and innovation.\n            (9) The United States is a Party to the United Nations \n        Framework Convention on Climate Change (referred to in this Act \n        as the ``Convention''), as agreed to by the advice and consent \n        of the Senate on October 7, 1992, and should remain actively \n        engaged in the Convention.\n            (10) In Paris, on December 12, 2015, parties to the \n        Convention reached a landmark agreement to strengthen the \n        global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a \n        global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-\n        industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the \n        temperature increase even further to 1.5\u000fC.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United \nStates should--\n            (1) utilize multilateral and bilateral foreign assistance \n        to promote low-carbon, climate-resilient development, including \n        supporting greater participation of women in the development \n        and implementation of climate policies that are gender-\n        responsive; and\n            (2) advance clean energy and climate resilience through \n        budgeting and operations of United States Government facilities \n        abroad.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Adaptation.--The term ``adaptation'' means an \n        adjustment in natural or human systems to a new or changing \n        environment that exploits beneficial opportunities or moderates \n        negative effects.\n            (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n        ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee on \n        Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the \n        House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations \n        and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate.\n            (3) Clean energy.--The term ``clean energy'' means any \n        electricity generation, transmission, storage, heating, \n        cooling, industrial process, or manufacturing project the \n        primary purpose of which is the deployment, development, or \n        production of an energy system or technology that avoids, \n        significantly reduces, or sequesters emissions of greenhouse \n        gas and other pollutants.\n            (4) Climate change.--The term ``climate change'' means \n        anthropogenic changes in average weather conditions that \n        persist over multiple decades or longer, and encompasses both \n        increases and decreases in temperature, as well as shifts in \n        precipitation, changing risk of certain types of severe weather \n        events, and changes to other features of the climate system.\n            (5) Climate security.--The term ``climate security'' has \n        the meaning given such term in section 120 of the National \n        Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3060).\n            (6) Mitigation.--The term ``mitigation'' means measures to \n        reduce the amount or speed of future climate change, including \n        by reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases or removing carbon \n        dioxide from the atmosphere.\n            (7) Resilient.--The term ``resilient'' means the capability \n        to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, or recover from \n        significant multihazard threats with minimum damage to social \n        well-being, health, the economy, or the environment.\n\nSEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Action Now Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In Paris, on December 12, 2015, parties to the United \n        Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reached \n        a landmark agreement to combat climate change and to accelerate \n        and intensify the actions and investments needed for a \n        sustainable low carbon future.\n            (2) The Paris Agreement's central aim is to strengthen the \n        global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a \n        global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-\n        industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the \n        temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n            (3) The Paris Agreement requires all parties to put forward \n        their best efforts through nationally determined contributions \n        (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead.\n            (4) The Paris Agreement further requires each party to \n        update its nationally determined contribution every 5 years, \n        with each successive nationally determined contribution \n        representing a progression beyond the previous nationally \n        determined contribution, and reflecting the party's highest \n        possible ambition.\n            (5) The United States communicated its nationally \n        determined contribution to achieve an economy-wide target of \n        reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below \n        its 2005 level in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its \n        emissions by 28 percent.\n            (6) A number of existing laws, regulations, and other \n        mandatory measures in the United States are relevant to \n        achieving this target, including the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n        7401 et seq.), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-\n        486), and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 \n        (Public Law 110-140).\n            (7) On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced his \n        intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris \n        Agreement, which would leave the United States as the only \n        UNFCCC member state that is not a signatory to the Paris \n        Agreement.\n            (8) Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, the earliest \n        possible effective withdrawal date by the United States is \n        November 4, 2020. However, the United States is still obligated \n        to maintain certain commitments under the Paris Agreement, such \n        as continuing to report its emissions to the United Nations.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO ADVANCE THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE \n              UNITED STATES FROM THE PARIS AGREEMENT.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no funds are authorized \nto be appropriated, obligated, or expended to take any action to \nadvance the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement.\n\nSEC. 4. PLAN FOR THE UNITED STATES TO MEET ITS NATIONALLY DETERMINED \n              CONTRIBUTION UNDER THE PARIS AGREEMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the President shall develop and submit to the \nappropriate congressional committees and make available to the public a \nplan for the United States to meet its nationally determined \ncontribution under the Paris Agreement that describes--\n            (1) how the United States will achieve an economy-wide \n        target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 \n        percent below its 2005 level by 2025; and\n            (2) how the United States will use the Paris Agreement's \n        transparency provisions to confirm that other parties to the \n        Agreement with major economies are fulfilling their announced \n        contributions to the Agreement.\n    (b) Updates to Plan.--Not later than one year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the President shall \nsubmit to the appropriate congressional committees and make available \nto the public an updated plan under subsection (a).\n    (c) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this section, \nthe term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n            (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on \n        Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives; and\n            (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on \n        Environment and Public Works, and the Committee on Energy and \n        Natural Resources of the Senate.\n\nSEC. 5. PARIS AGREEMENT DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``Paris Agreement'' means the decision by the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's 21st Conference \nof Parties in Paris, France, adopted December 12, 2015.\n                                 &lt;all&gt;\n</pre></body></html>\n", "BILLS-116hr9pcs": "<html><body><pre>\n[Congressional Bills 116th Congress]\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\n[H.R. 9 Placed on Calendar Senate (PCS)]\n\n&lt;DOC&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                        Calendar No. 79\n116th CONGRESS\n  1st Session\n                                 H.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Action Now Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In Paris, on December 12, 2015, parties to the United \n        Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reached \n        a landmark agreement to combat climate change and to accelerate \n        and intensify the actions and investments needed for a \n        sustainable low carbon future.\n            (2) The Paris Agreement's central aim is to strengthen the \n        global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a \n        global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-\n        industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the \n        temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n            (3) The Paris Agreement specifies the need for a strong \n        global response to climate change and when taking action, the \n        need to respect, promote, and safeguard the right to health now \n        and for future generations.\n            (4) The Paris Agreement acknowledges that all ``Parties \n        should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, \n        promote and consider their respective obligations on human \n        rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, \n        local communities, migrants, children, persons with \n        disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right \n        to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of \n        women and intergenerational equity''.\n            (5) The Paris Agreement notes the importance of ``climate \n        justice'' when mitigating and adapting to climate change and \n        recognizes ``the need for an effective and progressive response \n        to the urgent threat of climate change''.\n            (6) The Paris Agreement requires all parties to put forward \n        their best efforts through nationally determined contributions \n        (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead.\n            (7) The Paris Agreement further requires each party to \n        update its nationally determined contribution every 5 years, \n        with each successive nationally determined contribution \n        representing a progression beyond the previous nationally \n        determined contribution, and reflecting the party's highest \n        possible ambition.\n            (8) The Paris Agreement recognizes that the ocean \n        ecosystems covering more than 70 percent of the Earth's surface \n        have an integral role in climate balance. Seventy percent of \n        nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement \n        are ocean-inclusive, and 39 Paris Agreement signatories are \n        focused on the inclusion of ocean action in nationally \n        determined contributions through the Because the Ocean \n        Initiative.\n            (9) The United States communicated its nationally \n        determined contribution to achieve an economy-wide target of \n        reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below \n        its 2005 level in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its \n        emissions by 28 percent.\n            (10) A number of existing laws, regulations, and other \n        mandatory measures in the United States are relevant to \n        achieving this target, including the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n        7401 et seq.), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-\n        486), and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 \n        (Public Law 110-140).\n            (11) Essential in achieving this target is a thriving clean \n        energy industry in the United States, which currently employs \n        over 500,000 Americans.\n            (12) On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced his \n        intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris \n        Agreement, which would leave the United States as the only \n        UNFCCC member state that is not a signatory to the Paris \n        Agreement.\n            (13) Article 8 of the Paris Agreement notes Parties \n        recognize the importance of averting, minimizing and addressing \n        loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate \n        change, including extreme weather events and slow onset events, \n        and the role of sustainable development in reducing the risk of \n        loss and damage such as strong winds from hurricanes and \n        tropical storms, and flooding from storm surges and heavy rain, \n        that inflict losses on various sectors of the United States \n        economy.\n            (14) Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, the earliest \n        possible effective withdrawal date by the United States is \n        November 4, 2020. However, the United States is still obligated \n        to maintain certain commitments under the Paris Agreement, such \n        as continuing to report its emissions to the United Nations.\n            (15) The Paris Agreement further requires that parties \n        ``should strengthen their cooperation on enhancing action on \n        adaptation, taking into account the Cancun Adaptation \n        Framework'', which includes ``measures to enhance \n        understanding, coordination and cooperation with regard to \n        climate change induced displacement, migration and planned \n        relocation, where appropriate, at the national, regional and \n        international levels''.\n            (16) Article 8 of the Paris Agreement states that ``Parties \n        recognize the importance of averting, minimizing and addressing \n        loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate \n        change, including extreme weather events and slow onset \n        events'', such as sea level rise, saltwater intrusion, and \n        flooding.\n            (17) The Paris Agreement is an example of multilateral, \n        international cooperation needed to overcome challenges facing \n        the international community, such as reducing emissions, \n        promoting economic growth, and deploying clean energy \n        technologies.\n            (18) The Paris Agreement recognizes ``the fundamental \n        priority of safeguarding food security and ending hunger, and \n        the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to \n        the adverse impacts of climate change.''.\n            (19) The Paris Agreement recognizes that adaptation is a \n        global challenge faced by all with local, subnational, \n        national, regional and international dimensions, and that it is \n        a key component of and makes a contribution to the long-term \n        global response to climate change to protect people, \n        livelihoods, and ecosystems.\n            (20) American leadership encouraged widespread \n        international participation in the Paris Agreement.\n            (21) American cities, States, and businesses are stepping \n        up and pledging to meet the Paris Agreement goals in the wake \n        of absent and uncertain United States Federal leadership.\n            (22) Article 8 of the Paris Agreement states that ``Parties \n        recognize the importance of averting, minimizing and addressing \n        loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate \n        change, including extreme weather events and slow onset \n        events'' such as drought conditions and water scarcity.\n            (23) The Paris Agreement has driven innovation in \n        developing cleaner, more reliable, and more affordable forms of \n        energy, demonstrating that addressing climate change and \n        providing affordable energy to American consumers are not \n        mutually exclusive. The Paris Agreement encouraged the United \n        States to develop a Mid-Century Strategy for Deep \n        Decarbonization, which was submitted on November 16, 2016. The \n        Mid-Century Strategy for Deep Decarbonization stated that \n        ``energy efficiency improvements enable the energy system to \n        provide the services we need with fewer resources and \n        emissions. Over the past several years, the United States has \n        demonstrated that programs and standards to improve the energy \n        efficiency of buildings, appliances and vehicles can cost-\n        effectively cut carbon pollution and lower energy bills, while \n        maintaining significant support from U.S. industry and \n        consumers.''.\n            (24) In its nationally determined contribution, the United \n        States notes that pursuant to Executive Order No. 13693 (2015), \n        the Federal Government has committed to reduce emissions 40 \n        percent below 2005 levels by 2025, and reaffirmed the \n        Department of Defense's goal to procure renewable energy across \n        military installations and operations ``to drive national \n        greenhouse gas reductions and support preparations for the \n        impacts of climate change''.\n            (25) Article 10 of the Paris Agreement states that \n        ``Parties, noting the importance of technology for the \n        implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions under this \n        Agreement and recognizing existing technology deployment and \n        dissemination efforts, shall strengthen cooperative action on \n        technology development and transfer.''.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO ADVANCE THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE \n              UNITED STATES FROM THE PARIS AGREEMENT.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no funds are authorized \nto be appropriated, obligated, or expended to take any action to \nadvance the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement.\n\nSEC. 4. PLAN FOR THE UNITED STATES TO MEET ITS NATIONALLY DETERMINED \n              CONTRIBUTION UNDER THE PARIS AGREEMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the President shall develop and submit to the \nappropriate congressional committees and make available to the public a \nplan for the United States to meet its nationally determined \ncontribution under the Paris Agreement that describes--\n            (1) how the United States will achieve an economy-wide \n        target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 \n        percent below its 2005 level by 2025;\n            (2) how the United States will use the Paris Agreement's \n        transparency provisions to confirm that other parties to the \n        Agreement with major economies are fulfilling their announced \n        contributions to the Agreement;\n            (3) how the United States may use multilateral and \n        bilateral diplomatic tools, in addition to the expert committee \n        established under Article 15 of the Paris Agreement, to \n        encourage and assist other parties to the Agreement to fulfill \n        their announced contributions;\n            (4) how the Paris Agreement's loss and damage provisions \n        would affect infrastructure resiliency in the United States; \n        and\n            (5) how the plan takes into consideration populations, \n        regions, industries, and constituencies that could be affected \n        by nationally determined contribution under the Paris \n        Agreement, and the failure to meet such contribution, including \n        but not limited to--\n                    (A) American jobs, wage, and pay;\n                    (B) the cost of energy, such as electricity and \n                gasoline, for consumers;

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) climate change poses a significant and increasing \n        threat to the growth and stability of the economy of the United \n        States;\n            (2) many sectors of the economy of the United States and \n        many American businesses are exposed to multiple channels of \n        climate-related risk, which may include exposure to--\n                    (A) the physical impacts of climate change, \n                including the rise of the average global temperature, \n                accelerating sea-level rise, desertification, ocean \n                acidification, intensification of storms, increase in \n                heavy precipitation, more frequent and intense \n                temperature extremes, more severe droughts, and longer \n                wildfire seasons;\n                    (B) the economic disruptions and security threats \n                that result from the physical impacts described in \n                subparagraph (A) including conflicts over scarce \n                resources, conditions conducive to violent extremism, \n                the spread of infectious diseases, and forced \n                migration; and\n                    (C) the transition impacts that result as the \n                global economy transitions to a clean and renewable \n                energy, low-emissions economy, including financial \n                impacts as fossil fuel assets risk becoming stranded \n                and it becomes uneconomic for companies to develop \n                fossil fuel assets as policymakers act to limit the \n                worst impacts of climate change by keeping the rise in \n                average global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above \n                pre-industrial levels;\n            (3) assessing the potential impact of climate-related risks \n        on national and international financial systems is an urgent \n        concern;\n            (4) companies have a duty to disclose financial risks that \n        climate change presents to their investors, lenders, and \n        insurers;\n            (5) the Commission has a duty to promote a risk-informed \n        securities market that is worthy of the trust of the public as \n        families invest for their futures;\n            (6) investors, lenders, and insurers are increasingly \n        demanding climate risk information that is consistent, \n        comparable, reliable, and clear;\n            (7) including standardized, material climate change risk \n        and opportunity disclosure that is useful for decision makers \n        in annual reports to the Commission will increase transparency \n        with respect to risk accumulation and exposure in financial \n        markets;\n            (8) requiring companies to disclose climate-related risk \n        exposure and risk management strategies will encourage a \n        smoother transition to a clean and renewable energy, low-\n        emissions economy and guide capital allocation to mitigate, and \n        adapt to, the effects of climate change and limit damages \n        associated with climate-related events and disasters; and\n            (9) a critical component in fighting climate change is a \n        transparent accounting of the risks that climate change \n        presents and the implications of continued inaction with \n        respect to climate change.\n\nSEC. 4. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) short-, medium-, and long-term financial and economic \n        risks and opportunities relating to climate change, and the \n        national and global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, \n        constitute information that issuers--\n                    (A) may reasonably expect to affect shareholder \n                decision making; and\n                    (B) should regularly identify, evaluate, and \n                disclose; and\n            (2) the disclosure of information described in paragraph \n        (1) should--\n                    (A) identify, and evaluate--\n                            (i) material physical and transition risks \n                        posed by climate change; and\n                            (ii) the potential financial impact of such \n                        risks;\n                    (B) detail any implications such risks have on \n                corporate strategy;\n                    (C) detail any board-level oversight of material \n                climate related risks and opportunities;\n                    (D) allow for intra- and cross-industry comparison, \n                to the extent practicable, of climate-related risk \n                exposure through the inclusion of standardized \n                industry-specific and sector-specific disclosure \n                metrics, as identified by the Commission, in \n                consultation with the appropriate climate principals;\n                    (E) allow for tracking of performance over time \n                with respect to mitigating climate risk exposure; and\n                    (F) incorporate a price on greenhouse gas emissions \n                in financial analyses that reflects, at minimum, the \n                social cost of carbon that is attributable to issuers.\n\nSEC. 5.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, \n        climate change, which results in ocean warming, acidification, \n        and oxygen loss, is rapidly altering the abundance, \n        productivity, and distribution of fish stocks.\n            (2) United States commercial and recreational fisheries \n        generate approximately $210 billion in sales impacts each year \n        and are a critical economic driver for thousands of coastal \n        communities.\n            (3) Changing water temperatures have already affected many \n        commercially and recreationally targeted fish stocks.\n            (4) Changing conditions and effects on fish stocks are \n        impacting subsistence fishing, which is critical to food \n        security and culture for Alaska Native and American Indian \n        tribes, and fishing communities throughout the Nation, \n        according to the Fourth National Climate Assessment.\n            (5) The impacts of climate change on fish are resulting in \n        a cascade of management and sustainability challenges, which \n        negatively affect marine ecosystems, fishermen, and fishing \n        communities.\n            (6) A better understanding of current efforts underway by \n        the Regional Fishery Management Councils, the Atlantic States \n        Marine Fisheries Commission, and the National Marine Fisheries \n        Service to address the impact of climate change on fishery \n        management is needed to ensure our fisheries and their marine \n        ecosystems are well prepared for changing ocean conditions.\n\nSEC. 3. REPORT ON EFFORTS TO PREPARE AND ADAPT UNITED STATES FISHERY \n              MANAGEMENT FOR THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit \na report to Congress examining efforts by the Regional Fishery \nManagement Councils, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, \nand the National Marine Fisheries Service to prepare and adapt to the \nimpacts of climate change.\n    (b) Contents of Study.--The report required under subsection (a) \nshall include--\n            (1) an examination of current or previous efforts, and \n        whether those efforts have resulted in changes to management, \n        by the Regional Fishery Management Councils, the Atlantic \n        States Marine Fisheries Commission, and the National Marine \n        Fisheries Service to prepare and adapt Federal and jointly \n        managed fisheries for the impacts of climate change;\n            (2) an examination of any guidance issued to the Regional \n        Fishery Management Councils by the National Marine Fisheries \n        Service to prepare and adapt Federal fishery management for the \n        impacts of climate change and whether and how that guidance has \n        been utilized;\n            (3) identification of and recommendations for how best to \n        address the most significant economic, social, ecological, or \n        other knowledge gaps, as well as key funding gaps, that would \n        increase the ability of the Regional Fishery Management \n        Councils, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, or \n        the National Marine Fisheries Service to prepare and adapt \n        fishery management for the impacts of climate change;\n            (4) recommendations for how the Regional Fishery Management \n        Councils, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, and \n        the National Marine Fisheries Service can better adapt fishery \n        management and prepare associated fishing industries and \n        dependent communities for the impacts of climate change; and\n            (5) recommendations for how to enhance the capacity of the \n        National Marine Fisheries Service to monitor climate-related \n        changes to fisheries and marine ecosystems, to understand the \n        mechanisms of change, to evaluate risks and priorities, to \n        provide forecasts and projections of future conditions, to \n        communicate scientific advice, and to better manage fisheries \n        under changing conditions due to climate change.\n                                                 Union Calendar No. 527\n\n116th CONGRESS\n\n  2d Session\n\n                               H.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Action Now Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In Paris, on December 12, 2015, parties to the United \n        Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reached \n        a landmark agreement to combat climate change and to accelerate \n        and intensify the actions and investments needed for a \n        sustainable low carbon future.\n            (2) The Paris Agreement's central aim is to strengthen the \n        global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a \n        global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-\n        industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the \n        temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n            (3) The Paris Agreement requires all parties to put forward \n        their best efforts through nationally determined contributions \n        (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead.\n            (4) The Paris Agreement further requires each party to \n        update its nationally determined contribution every 5 years, \n        with each successive nationally determined contribution \n        representing a progression beyond the previous nationally \n        determined contribution, and reflecting the party's highest \n        possible ambition.\n            (5) The United States communicated its nationally \n        determined contribution to achieve an economy-wide target of \n        reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below \n        its 2005 level in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its \n        emissions by 28 percent.\n            (6) A number of existing laws, regulations, and other \n        mandatory measures in the United States are relevant to \n        achieving this target, including the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n        7401 et seq.), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-\n        486), and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 \n        (Public Law 110-140).\n            (7) On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced his \n        intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris \n        Agreement, which would leave the United States as the only \n        UNFCCC member state that is not a signatory to the Paris \n        Agreement.\n            (8) Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, the earliest \n        possible effective withdrawal date by the United States is \n        November 4, 2020. However, the United States is still obligated \n        to maintain certain commitments under the Paris Agreement, such \n        as continuing to report its emissions to the United Nations.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO ADVANCE THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE \n              UNITED STATES FROM THE PARIS AGREEMENT.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no funds are authorized \nto be appropriated, obligated, or expended to take any action to \nadvance the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement.\n\nSEC. 4.

Trump announced his intention to \n        withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement;\nWhereas, on May 2, 2019, the House of Representatives passed in a bipartisan \n        vote H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act, that would have kept the United \n        States in the Paris Agreement;\nWhereas, on November 4, 2019, the Trump administration gave the United Nations \n        formal notice of its intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris \n        Agreement, initiating the year-long withdrawal process;\nWhereas, on November 4, 2020, the United States became the first and only \n        signatory of the Paris Agreement to withdraw;\nWhereas, on November 4, 2020, President-elect Joseph R. Biden, Jr., stated that \n        the United States would rejoin the Paris Agreement on January 20, 2021, \n        the first day the new administration will take office;\nWhereas the human influence on the climate system is unequivocal and evident \n        from the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, \n        positive radiative forcing, observed warming, and understanding of the \n        climate system;\nWhereas sustained, robust Federal support of climate science, observations, and \n        modeling plays a key role in understanding the impacts of climate change \n        in the United States and around the world, and will increase in \n        importance as communities and the economy continue to feel the \n        intensifying effects of climate change;\nWhereas according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, without \n        additional mitigation efforts, there is a very high risk that global \n        warming by the end of the 21st century will lead to severe, widespread, \n        and irreversible impacts globally;\nWhereas according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special \n        Report on Climate Change and Land, the land surface air temperature has \n        risen nearly twice as much as the global average temperature since the \n        preindustrial period, and climate change has adversely impacted food \n        security, is contributing to desertification and land degradation, and \n        is creating stresses on land that exacerbate existing risks to \n        livelihoods, biodiversity, human and ecosystem health, infrastructure, \n        and food systems;\nWhereas according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special \n        Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, the sea level \n        continues to rise at an increasing rate, with the ocean projected to \n        experience increased temperatures, further acidification, oxygen \n        decline, and more frequent extreme weather events, exacerbating risks \n        for human communities in low-lying coastal areas;\nWhereas according to the National Climate Assessment, impacts of climate change \n        are already being felt in communities across the United States;\nWhereas according to the National Climate Assessment, the global average \n        temperature is projected to increase from 3 to 12 degrees Fahrenheit by \n        2100, which will cause a reduction in crop yields, alteration of \n        hydrological cycles, shrinkage of glaciers and ice sheets, thawing of \n        permafrost at high altitude, increase of flooding, wildfires, droughts, \n        heat waves, cyclones, and other extreme weather events, greater risk of \n        species extinctions, and more;\nWhereas according to the National Climate Assessment, the relative sea level is \n        projected to rise between about 2.5 and 11.5 feet by 2100 while ocean \n        warming and acidification increase, causing a proportional increase in \n        destructive coastal storms and surges, disruption of ecosystems \n        including spawning and migration patterns of key fisheries, displacement \n        of people on vulnerable coastlines and islands, and more;\nWhereas a 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that climate-\n        related impacts, such as coastal property damage, cost the Federal \n        Government $350,000,000,000;\nWhereas a November 2016 assessment by the Office of Management and Budget and \n        the Council of Economic Advisers found that recurring costs as a result \n        of climate change could increase the Federal Government's expenses by \n        $12,000,000,000 to $35,000,000,000 a year by midcentury, possibly \n        reaching more than $100,000,000,000 annually by the end of the century;\nWhereas climate change not only threatens the world's weather, biodiversity, and \n        ecosystems, but also threatens human security, economic vitality, and \n        social stability around the globe;\nWhereas the effects of climate change will only exacerbate issues of resource \n        scarcity, including lack of access to primary natural resources such as \n        fresh water and arable land for food production, thereby contributing to \n        increased conflict, poverty, food insecurity, and instability;\nWhereas this increased conflict and instability, as well as limited capacity to \n        adapt to extreme weather, may force large-scale displacement and both \n        internal and cross-border migration of people, thereby contributing to \n        increased risks to human security and economic systems;\nWhereas the impacts of climate change will often be most severely felt by poor \n        and socially excluded groups, such as ethnic minorities, women, older \n        people, and children, whose capacity to adapt to both rapid- and slow-\n        onset climate change is more limited;\nWhereas the global community can limit the risks of climate change by reducing \n        emissions of greenhouse gases and strengthening the capacity of \n        communities to adapt to climate change;\nWhereas to enable developing countries to combat climate change and adapt to its \n        impacts, developed countries will need to mobilize economic resources, \n        beginning with fulfilling their pledge of mobilizing $100,000,000,000 of \n        climate financing from both public and private sources annually \n        beginning in 2020, some of which will support the Green Climate Fund;\nWhereas the United States pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 \n        percent below 2005 levels in the United States by 2025, and to \n        contribute $3,000,000,000 to the Green Climate Fund;\nWhereas 29 States and the District of Columbia have adopted renewable portfolio \n        standard requirements, 23 States and the District of Columbia have \n        adopted greenhouse gas emissions targets, 27 States have adopted energy \n        efficiency resource standards, 13 States have adopted zero-emission or \n        low-emission vehicle targets, and 10 States have implemented the \n        Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative;\nWhereas more than 160 cities in the United States have adopted 100 percent clean \n        and renewable energy goals and 6 cities have already achieved this goal;\nWhereas more than 400 city leaders across the United States have joined the \n        Climate Mayors association, a bipartisan network of mayors working \n        together to lead on climate change through meaningful actions in their \n        communities, and to build political will for effective Federal and \n        global policy action for climate progress;\nWhereas 24 States, Puerto Rico, and American Samoa have joined the United States \n        Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of Governors committed to \n        reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris \n        Agreement;\nWhereas more than 3,000 bipartisan businesses, cities and counties, colleges and \n        universities, cultural institutions, health care organizations, faith \n        groups, States, and Tribal nations have signed the ``We're Still In'' \n        declaration, promising to world leaders that Americans will not retreat \n        from the global pact to reduce emissions and stem the causes of climate \n        change; and\nWhereas the Paris Agreement secured commitments from other member countries, \n        including China and India, for a global agreement that could prevent \n        catastrophic changes to our climate system and thus to societies around \n        the world: Now, therefore, be it\n    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n            (1) recognizes the 5th anniversary of the adoption of the \n        Paris Agreement;\n            (2) acknowledges that it is the responsibility of humankind \n        to address the severe and global impacts of climate change;\n            (3) supports global efforts that will keep global warming \n        below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), including \n        reduction of greenhouse gas emissions;\n            (4) supports global efforts, including increasing the \n        ambition of current climate financing goals, to protect those \n        most vulnerable to the effects of climate change;\n            (5) supports policies at the Federal, State, and local \n        levels that promote the reduction of greenhouse gas pollution \n        and aim to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement; and\n            (6) recommends that the United States rejoins the Paris \n        Agreement.\n                                 &lt;all&gt;\n</pre></body></html>\n", "BILLS-116hres367ih": "<html><body><pre>\n[Congressional Bills 116th Congress]\n[From the U.S. Government

Affairs\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n                               RESOLUTION\n\n\n \n Recognizing that climate change most severely impacts vulnerable and \n disadvantaged communities in the United States and around the world, \n and that it is the responsibility of the United States Government to \n  work with its global partners to promote environmental justice and \n                            climate justice.\n\nWhereas climate change poses an existential threat for this generation and \n        generations to come;\nWhereas the world is already experiencing the omnipresent danger of climate \n        change;\nWhereas the recent, current, and future impacts of changes in the Earth's \n        climate present real and immediate dangers to the United States and \n        countries around the world;\nWhereas there needs to be a global approach to addressing issues of climate \n        change and emergency preparedness;\nWhereas climate change is a threat multiplier to global conflicts, leading to \n        droughts, floods, hurricanes, heat waves, fires, natural disasters, and \n        food shortages, in turn exacerbating competition and conflict over \n        resources, displacing large populations, and creating migration and \n        refugee crises;\nWhereas the Fourth National Climate Assessment is in agreement with the \n        scientific community that ``the evidence of human-caused climate change \n        is overwhelming and continues to strengthen'';\nWhereas the Paris Agreement acknowledges that all ``Parties should, when taking \n        action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their \n        respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights \n        of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons \n        with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to \n        development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and \n        intergenerational equity'';\nWhereas the Paris Agreement notes the importance of ``climate justice'' when \n        mitigating and adapting to climate change and recognizes ``the need for \n        an effective and progressive response to the urgent threat of climate \n        change'';\nWhereas the Fourth National Climate Assessment states that ``people who are \n        already vulnerable, including lower-income communities and other \n        marginalized communities, have lower capacity to prepare for and cope \n        with extreme weather and climate-related events and are expected to \n        experience greater impacts'';\nWhereas the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Global \n        Warming of 1.5 \u000fC acknowledges that already vulnerable and marginalized \n        communities include communities of color, indigenous peoples, and \n        agrarian communities, among others, and that these communities \n        experience disproportionate impacts of climate change;\nWhereas the World Health Organization finds that 7,000,000 people die \n        prematurely every year from diseases exacerbated by air pollution, a \n        major contributor to climate change, around 90 percent of which are in \n        low- and middle-income countries;\nWhereas the World Health Organization considers air pollution as the greatest \n        environmental risk to health, and estimates that ``between 2030 and \n        2050, climate change is expected to cause 250,000 additional deaths per \n        year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress'';\nWhereas a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of \n        Sciences of the United States of America, Black and Hispanic individuals \n        in the United States face 56 percent and 63 percent more exposure to air \n        pollution, respectively, that is caused by their consumption of goods \n        and services that generate fine particulate matter;\nWhereas disparities in poverty and health will only increase as climate change \n        becomes more extreme;\nWhereas heat islands, urban areas with little green space leading to constantly \n        higher temperatures, disproportionately harm the health and well-being \n        of people of color and the elderly;\nWhereas access to clean water, in the United States and around the globe, is \n        severely impacted by climate change, adversely affecting communities of \n        color that already struggle with clean water access;\nWhereas studies demonstrate that catastrophic hurricanes impacting the United \n        States and Caribbean nations in recent years have been magnified by the \n        effects of climate change;\nWhereas families in the ``dry corridor'' of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador \n        lost up to 80 percent of their corn and bean crops in both the first and \n        second harvest seasons of 2018 due to drought;\nWhereas 300,000 subsistence farmers in Guatemala reported crop loss because of \n        low rainfall at the end of the year;\nWhereas rising temperatures, more extreme weather events, and increasingly \n        unpredictable rainfall patterns disrupt agricultural cycles, endangering \n        the livelihood of Central American farmers and driving migration;\nWhereas in southern Africa, crop yield losses compounded by climate change would \n        increase food prices by an average of 12 percent by 2030, placing a \n        drastic strain on poor households, who spend as much as 60 percent of \n        their income on food, the resulting malnutrition could lead to a 23 \n        percent increase in severe stunting of normal growth and development;\nWhereas 800,000,000 people in South Asia depend on water from the Himalayas, and \n        as temperatures warm and the ice recedes, the combination of droughts \n        and the reduced flow threaten Nepal's tourism industry as well as the \n        lives of rural farmers;\nWhereas Small Island Developing States acutely face health risks resulting from \n        climate change, which increases flooding due to sea-level rise and \n        raises exposure to infectious diseases due to the contamination of \n        freshwater supplies;\nWhereas the Climate Change and the Cost of Capital in Developing Countries \n        report of the United Nations Environment Programme finds that in the \n        last ten years, climate vulnerability has cost the twenty nations most \n        affected by catastrophes rooted in climate change an additional \n        $62,000,000,000 in interest payments alone; and\nWhereas the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review for the Department of Defense \n        highlights that climate change influences ``resource competition while \n        placing additional burdens on economies, societies, and government \n        institutions around the world,'' serving as ``threat multipliers that \n        will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental \n        degradation, political instability, and social tensions--conditions that \n        can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence'': Now, \n        therefore, be it\n    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n            (1) recognizes that climate change most severely impacts \n        vulnerable and disadvantaged communities in the United States \n        and around the world, and that it is the responsibility of the \n        United States Government to work with its global partners to \n        promote environmental justice and climate justice;\n            (2) recognizes that all efforts to adapt to and mitigate \n        climate change must include specific protections for and \n        acknowledgment of the harm to communities of color, indigenous \n        peoples, and other frontline communities around the world;\n            (3) recognizes that mitigating climate change must be a \n        global endeavor, in which the United States should act as a \n        leader among the international community;\n            (4) urges the United States Government to expand \n        collaboration and cooperation among its global partners to \n        pursue policies that prioritize climate adaptation among \n        vulnerable and disadvantaged communities, given the \n        disproportionate impact climate change has on minority \n        communities, who are least responsible for the causes of \n        climate change yet bear the greatest burden of its effects;\n            (5) expresses the need for all countries to promote \n        vulnerable community-focused adaptation to occur across all \n        sectors, including in agriculture, infrastructure, and health;\n            (6) recognizes and encourages all countries to undertake \n        inclusive stakeholder engagement when developing policies to \n        address environmental justice and climate justice; and\n            (7) expresses that immediate, multilateral action is needed \n        to drastically reduce global greenhouse gas emissions in order \n        to mitigate the effects of climate change.\n                                 &lt;all&gt;\n</pre></body></html>\n",

RESOLUTION\n\n\n \n  Expressing the need for immediate climate action in response to the \nUnited Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report \n           on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.\n\nWhereas every person on the planet benefits from a healthy ocean and a stable \n        cryosphere;\nWhereas the ocean covers more than 70 percent of the Earth's surface;\nWhereas the cryosphere includes the frozen components of the Earth's system, \n        including snow, glaciers, ice sheets, ice shelves, icebergs, sea ice, \n        and permafrost;\nWhereas glaciers, ice sheets, and permanent snow hold approximately 69 percent \n        of Earth's freshwater;\nWhereas the ocean generates the oxygen that we breathe, regulates our climate \n        and weather patterns, supplies food, is a source of cultural value, \n        supports tourism and trade, and is an untapped renewable energy \n        resource;\nWhereas the ocean and cryosphere support biodiversity and regulate the global \n        exchange of water, energy, and carbon;\nWhereas, on September 25, 2019, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on \n        Climate Change (IPCC) released the Special Report on the Ocean and \n        Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC);\nWhereas the SROCC is the most comprehensive scientific assessment of the effects \n        of climate change on our ocean and coasts, and polar and mountain \n        ecosystems to date;\nWhereas more than 100 scientists from 36 countries produced the SROCC and it was \n        reviewed by thousands of scientific experts from around the world;\nWhereas according to the SROCC--\n\n    (1) the ocean has taken up more than 90 percent of excess heat in the \nclimate system since 1970 and has warmed as a direct result of \nanthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions;\n\n    (2) marine heatwaves have very likely doubled in frequency from 1982 to \n2016 and are very likely to become longer-lasting, more intense, and more \nextensive;\n\n    (3) the rate of ocean warming has more than doubled since 1993;\n\n    (4) the ocean has very likely absorbed up to 30 percent of total \nanthropogenic carbon since the 1980s, causing the ocean to become more \nacidic;\n\n    (5) the ocean is losing oxygen at an unprecedented rate, and oxygen \nloss will very likely emerge over 59 to 80 percent of the ocean surface by \n2031-2050;\n\n    (6) harmful algal blooms have expanded and increased in frequency in \ncoastal environments since the 1980s as a result of ocean warming, \nacidification, and oxygen loss;\n\n    (7) in some regions, fish and shellfish stocks are already on the brink \nof collapsing;\n\n    (8) environmental stressors like ocean acidification, oxygen loss, and \nwarming ocean temperatures are expected to further compromise the \nabundance, productivity, and food-web interactions of species;\n\n    (9) the decrease in biodiversity, and decline and shifts in \ndistribution of fisheries will affect the livelihoods and food-security of \ncoastal communities;\n\n    (10) warmer ocean temperatures are fueling extreme weather events;\n\n    (11) currently rare extreme sea level events are expected to occur \nfrequently by 2050;\n\n    (12) in the absence of significant adaptation efforts, extreme events \nassociated with sea level rise, like erosion, flooding, and salinization, \nare expected to significantly increase;\n\n    (13) nearly 50 percent of coastal wetlands have been lost over the 20th \ncentury, and 20 to 90 percent of coastal wetlands are projected to be lost \nby 2100 as a result of sea level rise and habitat degradation;\n\n    (14) coastal blue carbon ecosystems can contribute to climate \nmitigation by storing carbon;\n\n    (15) river runoff in snow-dominated and glacier-fed basins are \nprojected to change in response to projected snow cover and glacier \ndecline;\n\n    (16) glacial and snow meltwater reductions have resulted in reduced \nwater supply, declined agriculture productivity, and increased wildfires in \nmountain regions and the Arctic;\n\n    (17) tourism and outdoor recreation activities have been negatively \naffected by the cryosphere decline;\n\n    (18) Arctic sea ice is declining in all months of the year and sea-ice \nfree summers are increasingly likely under 2\u000fC of global warming;\n\n    (19) Arctic surface air temperatures have likely increased by more than \ndouble the global average in the last two decades, resulting in more sea \nice and snow cover loss; and\n\n    (20) widespread thaw and degradation of permafrost is projected to \noccur this century and is anticipated to release tens to hundreds of \nbillions of tons of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere;\n\nWhereas the United States is already facing the consequences of inaction on \n        climate change;\nWhereas communities of color, Indigenous communities, and low-income communities \n        often face the disproportionate effects of inaction on climate change;\nWhereas reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to a clean energy \n        economy, and investing in climate adaptation efforts can support good-\n        paying jobs;\nWhereas, in 2018, the IPCC released a special report titled ``Global Warming of \n        1.5\u000fC'' which found that to limit global warming to 1.5\u000fC, net global \n        greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced to 45 percent below 2010 levels \n        by 2030 and 100 percent below 2010 levels by 2050;\nWhereas the United States has a responsibility to enact policies to reduce \n        greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent below 2010 levels no later than \n        2030 and achieve net zero emissions no later than 2050; and\nWhereas as Congress enacts policies to put the country on a path to net zero \n        emissions, there is an opportunity for the ocean to be part of the \n        climate solution: Now, therefore, be it\n    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n            (1) recognizes and accepts the findings of the \n        Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on the \n        Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate;\n            (2) commits to supporting ocean-centric solutions to the \n        climate crisis in conjunction with policies to reduce \n        greenhouse gas emissions including--\n                    (A) strengthening, restoring, and protecting our \n                wetlands, such as mangroves, tidal salt marshes, and \n                seagrass meadows to store blue carbon;\n                    (B) investing in ocean driven renewable energy, \n                including offshore wind, tidal, and wave energy, that \n                is responsibly sited and does not jeopardize the \n                integrity of marine ecosystems;\n                    (C) supporting the electrification of the maritime \n                industry and our ports;\n                    (D) advancing the exploration of the sequestration \n                potential of the deep sea;\n                    (E) permanently safeguarding our coasts from \n                offshore oil and gas drilling;\n                    (F) designing Marine Protected Areas that safeguard \n                ecosystems; and\n                    (G) strengthening scientific research and \n                monitoring to improve adaptation efforts to changing \n                ocean conditions; and\n            (3) affirms that immediate action is needed to reduce \n        greenhouse gas emissions to protect the health of our ocean and \n        the stability of the cryosphere.\n

Trump announced his intention to \n        withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement;\nWhereas, on November 4, 2019, the Trump administration gave the United Nations \n        formal notice of its intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris \n        Agreement, initiating the year-long withdrawal process;\nWhereas the United States is set to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on \n        November 4, 2020, and would be the first and only signatory of the Paris \n        Agreement to withdraw;\nWhereas the human influence on the climate system is unequivocal and evident \n        from the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, \n        positive radiative forcing, observed warming, and understanding of the \n        climate system;\nWhereas according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, without \n        additional mitigation efforts, there is a very high risk that global \n        warming by the end of the twenty-first century will lead to severe, \n        widespread, and irreversible impacts globally;\nWhereas according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special \n        Report on Climate Change and Land, the land surface air temperature has \n        risen nearly twice as much as the global average temperature since the \n        preindustrial period and climate change has adversely impacted food \n        security, contributing to desertification and land degradation, creating \n        stresses on land that exacerbate existing risks to livelihoods, \n        biodiversity, human and ecosystem health, infrastructure, and food \n        systems;\nWhereas according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special \n        Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, sea level \n        continues to rise at an increasing rate, with the ocean projected to \n        experience increased temperatures, further acidification, oxygen \n        decline, and more frequent extreme whether events, exacerbating risks \n        for human communities in low-lying coastal areas;\nWhereas according to the National Climate Assessment, impacts of climate change \n        are already being felt in communities across the United States;\nWhereas according to the National Climate Assessment, the global average \n        temperature is projected to increase from 3 to 12 degrees Fahrenheit by \n        2100, which will cause a reduction in crop yields, alteration of \n        hydrological cycles, shrinkage of glaciers and ice sheets, thawing of \n        permafrost at high altitude, increase of flooding, wildfires, droughts, \n        heat waves, cyclones, and other extreme weather events, greater risk of \n        species extinctions, and more;\nWhereas according to the National Climate Assessment, the relative sea level is \n        projected to rise between about 2.5 and 11.5 feet by 2100 while ocean \n        warming and acidification increases, causing a proportional increase in \n        destructive coastal storms and surges, disruption of ecosystems \n        including spawning and migration patterns of key fisheries, displacement \n        of people on vulnerable coastlines and islands, and more;\nWhereas a 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that climate-\n        related impacts, such as coastal property damage, cost the Federal \n        Government $350 billion;\nWhereas a November 2016 assessment by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \n        and the Council of Economic Advisers found that recurring costs as a \n        result of climate change could increase the Federal Government's \n        expenses by $12 billion to $35 billion a year by midcentury, possibly \n        reaching more than $100 billion annually by the end of the century;\nWhereas climate change not only threatens our world's weather, biodiversity, and \n        ecosystems, but also threatens human security, economic vitality, and \n        social stability around the globe;\nWhereas the effects of climate change will only exacerbate issues of resource \n        scarcity, including lack of access to primary natural resources such as \n        fresh water and arable land for food production, thereby contributing to \n        increased conflict, poverty, food insecurity, and instability;\nWhereas this increased conflict and instability, as well as limited capacity to \n        adapt to extreme weather, may force large-scale displacement and \n        internal and cross-border migration of people, thereby contributing to \n        increased risks to human security and economic systems;\nWhereas the impacts of climate change will often be most severely felt by poor \n        and socially excluded groups, such as ethnic minorities, women, older \n        people, and children, whose capacity to adapt to both rapid- and slow-\n        onset climate change is more limited;\nWhereas the global community can limit the risks of climate change by reducing \n        emissions of greenhouse gases and strengthening the capacity of \n        communities to adapt to climate change;\nWhereas to enable developing countries to combat climate change and adapt to its \n        impacts, developed countries will need to mobilize economic resources, \n        beginning with fulfilling their pledge of mobilizing $100 billion of \n        climate financing from both public and private sources annually \n        beginning in 2020, some of which will support the Green Climate Fund;\nWhereas the United States pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 \n        percent below 2005 levels in the United States by 2025, and to \n        contribute $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund;\nWhereas 29 States and the District of Columbia have adopted renewable portfolio \n        standard requirements, 23 States and the District of Columbia have \n        adopted greenhouse gas emissions targets, 26 States have adopted energy \n        efficiency resource standards, 13 States have adopted zero-emission or \n        low-emission vehicle targets, and 10 States have implemented the \n        Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative;\nWhereas more than 145 cities in the United States have adopted 100 percent clean \n        and renewable energy goals and six cities have already achieved this \n        goal;\nWhereas more than 400 city leaders across the United States have joined the \n        Climate Mayors association, a bipartisan network of mayors working \n        together to lead on climate change through meaningful actions in their \n        communities, and to build political will for effective Federal and \n        global policy action for climate progress;\nWhereas 24 States and Puerto Rico have joined the United States Climate \n        Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of Governors committed to reducing \n        greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris \n        Agreement;\nWhereas more than 3,000 businesses, cities and counties, colleges and \n        universities, cultural institutions, health care organizations, faith \n        groups, States, and Tribal nations have signed the We're Still In \n        declaration, a bipartisan group promising to world leaders that \n        Americans will not retreat from the global pact to reduce emissions and \n        stem the causes of climate change; and\nWhereas the Paris Agreement secured commitments from other member countries, \n        including China and India, for a global agreement that could prevent \n        catastrophic changes to our climate system and thus to societies around \n        the world: Now, therefore, be it\n    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n            (1) recognizes the 4th anniversary of the adoption of the \n        Paris Agreement;\n            (2) acknowledges it is the responsibility of humankind to \n        address the severe and global impacts of climate change;\n            (3) supports global efforts that will keep global warming \n        below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), including \n        reduction of greenhouse gas emissions;\n            (4) supports global efforts to protect those most \n        vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including \n        increasing the ambition of current climate financing goals;\n            (5) supports policies at the Federal, State, and local \n        levels that promote the reduction of greenhouse gas pollution \n        and aim to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement; and\n            (6) recommends that the United States remain a signatory to \n        the Paris Agreement.\n

and\n\n    (3) must be reduced to not more than 350 parts per million, and likely \nlower, ``if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which \ncivilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted,'' according \nto former National Aeronautics and Space Administration climatologist, Dr. \nJames Hansen;\n\nWhereas global atmospheric concentrations of other greenhouse gases, including \n        methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons, have also increased \n        substantially since preindustrial times, primarily due to human \n        activities, including burning fossil fuels;\nWhereas current climate science and real-world observations of climate change \n        impacts, including ocean warming and acidification, floods, droughts, \n        wildfires, and extreme weather, demonstrate that a global rise in \n        temperatures of 1 degree Celsius above preindustrial levels is already \n        having dangerous impacts on human populations and the environment;\nWhereas the 2018 National Climate Assessment found that climate change due to \n        global warming has caused, and is expected to cause additional, \n        substantial interference with and growing losses to infrastructure, \n        property, industry, recreation, natural resources, agricultural systems, \n        human health and safety, and quality of life in the United States;\nWhereas the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has determined that \n        climate change is already increasing the frequency of extreme weather \n        and other climate-related disasters, including drought, wildfire, and \n        storms that include precipitation;\nWhereas climate-related natural disasters have increased exponentially over the \n        past decade, costing the United States more than double the long-term \n        average during the period of 2014 through 2018, with total costs of \n        natural disasters during that period of approximately $100,000,000,000 \n        per year;\nWhereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found wide-ranging, \n        acute, and fatal public health consequences from climate change that \n        impact communities across the United States;\nWhereas the National Climate and Health Assessment of the United States Global \n        Change Research Program identified climate change as a significant \n        threat to the health of the people of the United States, leading to \n        increased--\n\n    (1) temperature-related deaths and illnesses;\n\n    (2) air quality impacts;\n\n    (3) extreme weather events;\n\n    (4) numbers of vector-borne diseases;\n\n    (5) waterborne illnesses;\n\n    (6) food safety, nutrition, and distribution complications; and\n\n    (7) mental health and well-being concerns;\n\nWhereas the consequences of climate change already disproportionately impact \n        frontline communities and endanger populations made especially \n        vulnerable by existing exposure to extreme weather events, such as \n        children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing disabilities \n        and health conditions;\nWhereas individuals and families on the frontlines of climate change across the \n        United States, including territories, living with income inequality and \n        poverty, institutional racism, inequity on the basis of gender and \n        sexual orientation, poor infrastructure, and lack of access to health \n        care, housing, clean water, and food security are often in close \n        proximity to environmental stressors or sources of pollution, \n        particularly communities of color, indigenous communities, and low-\n        income communities, which--\n\n    (1) experience outsized risk because of the close proximity of the \ncommunity to environmental hazards and stressors, in addition to colocation \nwith waste and other sources of pollution;\n\n    (2) are often the first exposed to the impacts of climate change; and\n\n    (3) have the fewest resources to mitigate those impacts or to relocate, \nwhich will exacerbate preexisting challenges;\n\nWhereas, according to Dr. Robert Bullard and Dr. Beverly Wright, ``environmental \n        and public health threats from natural and human-made disasters are not \n        randomly distributed,'' therefore a response to the climate emergency \n        necessitates the adoption of just community transition policies and \n        processes available to all communities, which include policies and \n        processes rooted in principles of racial and socio-economic equity, \n        self-determination, and democracy, as well as the fundamental human \n        right of all people to clean air and water, healthy food, health care, \n        adequate land, education, and shelter;\nWhereas climate change holds grave and immediate consequences not just for the \n        population of the United States, including territories, but for \n        communities across the world, particularly those communities in the \n        Global South on the frontlines of the climate crisis, which are at risk \n        of forced displacement;\nWhereas communities in rural, urban, and suburban areas are all dramatically \n        affected by climate change, though the specific economic, health, \n        social, and environmental impacts may be different;\nWhereas the United States Department of State, Department of Defense, and \n        intelligence community have identified climate change as a threat to \n        national security, and the Department of Homeland Security views climate \n        change as a top homeland security risk;\nWhereas climate change is a threat multiplier--\n\n    (1) with the potential to exacerbate many of the challenges the United \nStates already confronts, including conflicts over scarce resources, \nconditions conducive to violent extremism, and the spread of infectious \ndiseases; and\n\n    (2) because climate change has the potential to produce new, \nunforeseeable challenges in the future;\n\nWhereas, in 2018, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n        projected that the Earth could warm 1.5 degrees Celsius above \n        preindustrial levels as early as 2030;\nWhereas the climatic changes resulting from global warming above 1.5 degrees \n        Celsius above preindustrial levels, including changes resulting from \n        global warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial \n        levels, are projected to result in irreversible, catastrophic changes to \n        public health, livelihoods, quality of life, food security, water \n        supplies, human security, and economic growth;\nWhereas, in 2019, the United Nations Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform \n        on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services found that human-induced climate \n        change is pushing the planet toward the sixth mass species extinction, \n        which threatens the food security, water supply, and well-being of \n        billions of people;\nWhereas, according to climate scientists, limiting warming to no more than 1.5 \n        degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, and likely lower, is most \n        likely to avoid irreversible and catastrophic climate change;\nWhereas, even with global warming up to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial \n        levels, the planet is projected to experience--\n\n    (1) a significant rise in sea levels;\n\n    (2) extraordinary loss of biodiversity; and\n\n    (3) intensifying droughts, prodigious floods, devastating wildfires, \nand other extreme weather events;\n\nWhereas, according to climate scientists, addressing the climate emergency will \n        require an economically just and managed phase-out oil, gas, and coal to \n        keep fossil fuels in the ground;\nWhereas the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has \n        determined that limiting warming through emissions reduction and carbon \n        sequestration will require rapid, and immediate, acceleration and \n        proliferation of ``far-reaching, multilevel, and cross-sectoral climate \n        mitigation'' and ``transitions in energy, land, urban and rural \n        infrastructure (including transport and buildings), and industrial \n        systems'';\nWhereas, in the United States, massive, comprehensive, and urgent governmental \n        action is required immediately to achieve the transitions of those \n        systems in response to the severe existing and projected economic, \n        social, public health, and national security threats posed by the \n        climate crisis;\nWhereas the massive scope and scale of action necessary to stabilize the climate \n        will require unprecedented levels of public awareness, engagement, and \n        deliberation to develop and implement effective, just, and equitable \n        policies to address the climate crisis;\nWhereas failure to mobilize to solve the climate emergency is antithetical to \n        the spirit of the Declaration of Independence in protecting \n        ``unalienable Rights'' that include ``Life, Liberty and the pursuit of \n        Happiness'';\nWhereas the United States has a proud history of collaborative, constructive, \n        massive-scale Federal mobilizations of resources and labor in order to \n        solve great challenges, such as the Interstate Highway System, the \n        Apollo 11 Moon landing, Reconstruction, the New Deal, and World War II;\nWhereas the United States stands uniquely poised to substantially grow the \n        economy and attain social and health benefits from a massive \n        mobilization of resources and labor that far outweigh the costs of \n        inaction;\nWhereas millions of middle class jobs can be created by raising labor standards \n        through project labor agreements and protecting and expanding the right \n        of workers to organize so that workers in the United States and the \n        communities of those workers are guaranteed a strong, viable economic \n        future in a zero-emissions economy that guarantees good jobs at fair \n        union wages, with quality benefits;\nWhereas frontline communities, Tribal governments and communities, people of \n        color, and labor unions must be equitably and actively engaged in the \n        climate mobilization and prioritized through local climate mitigation \n        and adaptation planning, policy, and program delivery so that workers in \n        the United States, the communities of those workers, are guaranteed a \n        strong, viable economic future;\nWhereas a number of local jurisdictions and governments in the United States, \n        including New York City and Los Angeles, and across the world, including \n        the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Portugal, and Canada, have \n        already declared a climate emergency, and a number of State and local \n        governments are considering declaring a climate emergency in response to \n        the massive challenges posed by the climate crisis;\nWhereas State, local, and Tribal governments must be supported in efforts to \n        hold to account actors whose activities have deepened and accelerated \n        the climate crisis and who have benefitted from delayed action to \n        address the climate change emergency and to develop a fossil fuel-free \n        economy;\nWhereas a collaborative response to the climate crisis will require the Federal \n        Government to work with international, State, and local governments, \n        including with those governments that have declared a climate emergency, \n        to reverse the impacts of the climate crisis; and\nWhereas the United States has an obligation, as a driver of accelerated climate \n        change, to mobilize at emergency speed to restore a safe climate and \n        environment not just for communities of the United States, including \n        territories, but for communities across the world, particularly those on \n        the frontlines of the climate crisis who have least contributed to the \n        crisis, and to account for global and community impacts of any actions \n        it takes in response to the climate crisis: Now, therefore, be it\n    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), \nThat it is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the global warming caused by human activities, which \n        increase emissions of greenhouse gases, has resulted in a \n        climate emergency that--\n                    (A) severely and urgently impacts the economic and \n                social well-being, health and safety, and national \n                security of the United States; and\n                    (B) demands a national, social, industrial, and \n                economic mobilization of the resources and labor of the \n                United States at a massive-scale to halt, reverse, \n                mitigate, and prepare for the consequences of the \n                climate emergency and to restore the climate for future \n                generations; and\n            (2) nothing in this concurrent resolution constitutes a \n        declaration of a national emergency for purposes of any Act of \n        Congress authorizing the exercise, during the period of a \n        national emergency or other type of declared emergency, of any \n        special or extraordinary power.\n                                 &lt;all&gt;\n</pre></body></html>\n", "BILLS-116sconres47is": "<html><body><pre>\n[Congressional Bills 116th Congress]\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\n[S.

which was referred to the Committee on \n                      Environment and Public Works\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION\n\n\n \nRecognizing that the climate crisis is disproportionately affecting the \n   health, economic opportunity, and fundamental rights of children, \nexpressing the sense of Congress that renewed leadership by the United \n  States is needed to address the climate crisis, and recognizing the \n  need of the United States to develop a national, comprehensive, and \nscience-based climate recovery plan to phase out fossil fuel emissions, \nprotect and enhance natural sequestration, and put the United States on \n             a path toward stabilizing the climate system.\n\nWhereas a stable climate system at the founding of the United States allowed \n        human life and human civilization to flourish;\nWhereas the United States was founded on the deeply rooted principle of securing \n        ``the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity'';\nWhereas the Constitution of the United States protects the fundamental rights to \n        life, liberty, property, and equal protection of the laws;\nWhereas a climate system capable of sustaining human life--\n\n    (1) is fundamental to a free and ordered society; and\n\n    (2) is preservative of fundamental rights, including the rights to \nlife, liberty, property, personal security, family autonomy, bodily \nintegrity, and the ability to learn, practice, and transmit cultural and \nreligious traditions;\n\nWhereas the Federal Government sets the energy policy of the United States, \n        which has resulted in a national energy system in which approximately 80 \n        percent of the energy in the United States comes from fossil fuels;\nWhereas the national fossil fuel-based energy system has led to carbon dioxide \n        emissions from the United States constituting more than \\1/4\\ of \n        cumulative global carbon dioxide emissions;\nWhereas the United States is the largest producer of oil and gas in the world, \n        due in substantial part to the Federal Government--\n\n    (1) opening up Federal public land and water for fossil fuel \nextraction; and\n\n    (2) actively supporting fossil fuel energy;\n\nWhereas there is an overwhelming scientific consensus that--\n\n    (1) human-caused climate change is occurring; and\n\n    (2) the rate of global heating and ocean acidification as of September \n2020 is a result of the buildup of atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions, \nprimarily carbon dioxide emissions, largely from the combustion of fossil \nfuels;\n\nWhereas atmospheric carbon dioxide levels of over 400 parts per million as of \n        September 2020 have caused a dangerous planetary energy imbalance, \n        equivalent to the quantity of energy of exploding more than 400,000 \n        atomic bombs of the kind dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, per day, 365 days \n        per year, across the planet;\nWhereas the latest climate science and real-world observations of that energy \n        imbalance demonstrate that the approximately 1 degree Celsius of warming \n        that has already occurred as a result of human-caused climate change is \n        already dangerous and negatively affecting all aspects of society and \n        the economy of the United States;\nWhereas the last time that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide were \n        over 400 parts per million--\n\n    (1) the seas were 70 to 90 feet higher;\n\n    (2) Greenland had no ice; and\n\n    (3) coral reefs suffered a major extinction;\n\nWhereas similar conditions will result if the United States does not drastically \n        reduce carbon dioxide emissions and naturally sequester excess \n        concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide during the 21st century;\nWhereas climate change is a threat to national security, as climate change \n        contributes to and exacerbates global instability and conflict;\nWhereas the generation of today's children was born into a climate system made \n        hazardous to their health and well-being because of human-caused climate \n        change;\nWhereas children are uniquely vulnerable to human-caused climate change because \n        of their developing bodies, higher exposure to air, food, and water per \n        unit of body weight, unique behavior patterns, dependence on caregivers, \n        and longevity on the planet;\nWhereas human-caused climate change is a public health emergency that is \n        adversely impacting the physical and mental health of children through--\n\n    (1) extreme weather events;\n\n    (2) rising temperatures and increased heat exposure;\n\n    (3) decreased air quality;\n\n    (4) altered infectious disease patterns;\n\n    (5) food and water insecurity; and\n\n    (6) other effects;\n\nWhereas infant mortality increases 25 percent on extremely hot days, with the \n        first 7 days of life representing a period of critical vulnerability;\nWhereas heat illness is a leading cause of death and illness in high school \n        athletes, with nearly 10,000 episodes of heat illness occurring \n        annually;\nWhereas 8.4 percent of children suffer from allergic rhinitis, and the ragweed \n        pollen season in North America has grown 13 to 27 days longer since 1995 \n        due to higher temperatures and greater atmospheric carbon dioxide \n        levels;\nWhereas children exposed to wildfires suffer substantial--\n\n    (1) eye symptoms; and\n\n    (2) upper and lower respiratory symptoms that lead to increased rates \nof asthma-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits;\n\nWhereas extreme weather events can negatively impact the mental health of \n        children due to--\n\n    (1) family loss or separation;\n\n    (2) school interruption;\n\n    (3) scarcities of food, water, and shelter; and\n\n    (4) public service outages;\n\nWhereas, without immediate steps to address human-caused climate change, the \n        health effects of climate change on children will--\n\n    (1) increase in severity and in terms of the number of children \nimpacted; and\n\n    (2) cost the United States billions of dollars per year by the end of \nthe 21st century;\n\nWhereas children will largely shoulder the costs of human-caused climate change;\nWhereas further increases in global temperature will saddle children with an \n        enormous, perhaps incalculable, cost burden, undermining their economic \n        security and the economic security of the United States;\nWhereas children are deserving of special consideration and protection with \n        respect to human-caused climate change;\nWhereas children on the frontlines of human-caused climate change across the \n        United States and globally have risen up and called upon government \n        leaders around the world to take concrete, science-based, and equitable \n        action--\n\n    (1) to address human-caused climate change; and\n\n    (2) to ensure climate justice for their generation, future generations, \nand frontline and vulnerable communities, including communities of color, \nlow-income communities, and indigenous peoples;\n\nWhereas global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations must be reduced to \n        below 350 parts per million by the end of the 21st century, with further \n        reductions thereafter, to restore the energy balance of the planet, \n        stabilize the climate system, and protect the ice sheets and oceans for \n        posterity;\nWhereas existing and future adverse public health and other impacts and costs to \n        children and the United States can be significantly mitigated if the \n        United States acts promptly to reduce emissions from fossil fuels in the \n        United States;\nWhereas numerous experts have concluded that there are multiple technically and \n        economically feasible pathways to place all sectors of the economy of \n        the United States on an emissions-reduction path consistent with \n        returning global atmospheric carbon dioxide to 350 parts per million by \n        2100;\nWhereas producing energy in the United States with noncarbon-emitting sources \n        will result in energy costs within the range of recent experience, \n        ultimately saving consumers money and stabilizing the cost of energy, \n        while increasing the number of jobs in the energy sector; and\nWhereas multiple Federal departments and agencies can exercise authority \n        delegated by Congress to prevent and respond to climate change, \n        including--\n\n    (1) the Department of Energy;\n\n    (2) the Department of the Interior;\n\n    (3) the Department of Agriculture;\n\n    (4) the Environmental Protection Agency;\n\n    (5) the Department of Commerce; and\n\n    (6) the Department of State: Now, therefore, be it\n\n    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), \nThat it is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) renewed leadership by the United States is needed \n        immediately to address the human-caused climate crisis that is \n        disproportionately affecting the health, economic opportunity, \n        and fundamental rights of the children of the United States; \n        and\n            (2) there is a human-caused climate crisis that--\n                    (A) has inspired children across the United States \n                to organize and demand immediate government action to \n                protect their fundamental rights from the perils of \n                climate change; and\n                    (B) demands a national, comprehensive, science-\n                based, and just climate recovery plan that--\n                            (i) is prepared by Federal departments and \n                        agencies pursuant to delegated authority over \n                        energy and climate policy; and\n                            (ii) to uphold the fundamental rights of \n                        children, puts the United States on a \n                        trajectory consistent with reducing global \n                        atmospheric carbon dioxide to below 350 parts \n                        per million by 2100.\n                                 &lt;all&gt;\n</pre></body></html>\n"}}
