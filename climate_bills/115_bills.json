Ten of the world's warmest years on record have \n        occurred since 2000, and 2016 was the warmest year ever \n        recorded.\n            (2) The warming of our planet has led to more frequent, \n        dangerous and expensive extreme weather events, including heat \n        waves, storms, fires, droughts, floods and tornadoes.\n            (3) More than 97 percent of climate scientists agree that \n        our planet is warming, primarily because of the extraction and \n        burning of fossil fuels.\n            (4) The atmosphere is a common resource that belongs \n        equally to all.\n            (5) Stabilizing the climate can and must be done in a way \n        that supports vibrant economic growth and a thriving middle \n        class.\n            (6) Legislation to address climate change and accelerate \n        the transition to a clean energy economy must be fair, \n        transparent and built to last.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Change Education Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The evidence for human-induced climate change is \n        overwhelming and undeniable.\n            (2) Atmospheric carbon can be significantly reduced through \n        conservation, by shifting to renewable energy sources such as \n        solar, wind, tidal, and geothermal, and by increasing the \n        efficiency of buildings, including domiciles, and \n        transportation.\n            (3) Providing clear information about climate change, in a \n        variety of forms, can remove the fear and the sense of \n        helplessness, and encourage individuals and communities to take \n        action.\n            (4) Implementation of measures that promote energy \n        efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy will greatly \n        reduce human impact on the environment.\n            (5) Informing people of new technologies and programs as \n        they become available will ensure maximum understanding and \n        maximum effect of those measures.\n            (6) More than 3,000,000 students graduate from high schools \n        and colleges each year, armed with attitudes, skills, and \n        knowledge about the climate that inform their actions.\n            (7) The effect on the climate, positive or negative, of \n        each of those 3,000,000 students lasts beyond a lifetime.\n            (8) Those students need to be prepared to implement changes \n        in professional and personal practices, to support and help \n        develop new technology and policy, and to address the coming \n        social and economic challenges and opportunities arising from a \n        changing climate.\n            (9) It has been demonstrated that the people of the United \n        States overwhelmingly support teaching students about the \n        causes, consequences, and potential solutions to climate change \n        in all 50 States and more than 3,000 counties across the United \n        States.\n            (10) Only 30 percent of middle school and 45 percent of \n        high school science teachers understand the extent of the \n        scientific consensus on climate change.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Solutions Act of 2017''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The United States has the objective of stabilizing \n        greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that \n        would prevent ``dangerous anthropogenic interference'' with the \n        climate system as demonstrated by becoming a party to the 1992 \n        United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, pledging \n        to China to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 28 percent of \n        their 2005 levels by 2025, and regulating greenhouse gas \n        emissions from stationary sources, mobile sources, and \n        electrical power suppliers.\n            (2) To achieve this objective, the increase in global mean \n        surface temperature should not exceed 2\u000fC (3.6\u000fF) above \n        preindustrial temperature, much of which is already projected \n        to occur by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n            (3) The risks associated with a temperature increase above \n        2\u000fC (3.6\u000fF) are grave, including the disintegration of the \n        Greenland ice sheet, which, if it were to melt completely, \n        would raise global average sea level by approximately 23 feet, \n        devastating many of the world's coastal areas and population \n        centers.\n            (4) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects \n        that temperatures will rise between 1.8\u000fC to 4.0\u000fC (3.2\u000fF to \n        7.2\u000fF) by the end of the century, under a range of expected \n        emissions trends, but if there are common goals to limit \n        greenhouse gas emissions, the temperature increase can be \n        limited to 2\u000fC (3.6\u000fF) or less.\n            (5) Serious global warming impacts have already been \n        observed in the United States and worldwide, including--\n                    (A) increases in heat waves and other extreme \n                weather events;\n                    (B) rise in sea level, retreat of glaciers and \n                polar ice;\n                    (C) decline in mountain snowpack, increased drought \n                (including droughts in the West and South United \n                States) resulting in damage to our economy and \n                property;\n                    (D) extreme weather conditions resulting in \n                wildfires, stronger hurricanes and polar vortex \n                occurrences resulting in further damage to property and \n                our economy;\n                    (E) damage to our environment such as ocean \n                acidification, extensive coral bleaching, migrations, \n                and shifts in the yearly cycles of plants and animals; \n                and\n                    (F) effects on human population including \n                population displacement and adverse health effects such \n                as the spread of infectious diseases and climate-\n                related conditions such as asthma.\n            (6) Scientists project that under a midrange estimate of \n        global warming, by 2050, roughly 25 percent of animal and plant \n        species will be committed to extinction.\n            (7) Decisive action is needed to minimize the many dangers \n        posed by global warming.\n            (8) The timing of such action is critical, given that \n        greenhouse gases can persist in the atmosphere for more than a \n        century.\n            (9) The International Energy Agency has warned in its most \n        recent World Energy Outlook report that, unless there is a \n        serious commitment to investing in zero carbon renewable energy \n        resources, much of the amount of projected limits necessary to \n        avoid greenhouse-gas-emission-caused dangerous anthropogenic \n        interference with the climate system will be locked in and \n        exceeded.\n            (10) PricewaterhouseCoopers Low Carbon Economy Index Report \n        estimates that carbon-based fuel use needs to be reduced 6.5 \n        percent per year through the year 2100, nearly six times the \n        current rate, to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference \n        with the climate system.\n            (11) With only 5 percent of the world population, the \n        United States emits approximately 20 percent of the world's \n        total greenhouse gas emissions and must be a leader in \n        addressing global warming.\n            (12) The State of California, the 6th largest economy in \n        the world, has shown that renewable energy standards and \n        greenhouse gas emissions regulation can reduce greenhouse gas \n        emissions while fostering significant economic growth.\n            (13) Existing energy efficiency and clean, renewable energy \n        technologies can reduce global warming pollution, while saving \n        consumers money, reducing our dependence on oil, enhancing \n        national security, cleaning the air, and protecting pristine \n        places from drilling and mining.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the \nUnited States should participate in negotiations under the 1992 United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change and honor its \ncommitments therefrom with the objective of securing and continuing \nUnited States participation in agreements, including the Paris \nAgreement that the United States accepted on September 3, 2016, and \ntook effect on November 4, 2016, that--\n            (1) establish mitigation commitments by all countries that \n        are major emitters of greenhouse gases, consistent with the \n        principle of common but differentiated responsibilities;\n            (2) achieve reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions \n        at a pace and level sufficient to avoid dangerous interference \n        with the Earth's climate; and\n            (3) advance and protect the economic and national security \n        interests of the United States.\n\n                       TITLE I--RENEWABLE ENERGY\n\nSEC. 101.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions \n        continue to rise. In 2013, CO&lt;INF&gt;2&lt;/INF&gt; levels in the \n        atmosphere reached 400 parts per million for the first time in \n        human history. Ten of the world's warmest years on record have \n        occurred since 2000, and 2016 was the warmest year ever \n        recorded.\n            (2) The warming of our planet has led to more frequent, \n        dangerous and expensive extreme weather events, including heat \n        waves, storms, fires, droughts, floods and tornadoes.\n            (3) More than 97 percent of climate scientists agree that \n        our planet is warming, primarily because of the extraction and \n        burning of fossil fuels.\n            (4) The atmosphere is a common resource that belongs \n        equally to all.\n            (5) Stabilizing the climate can and must be done in a way \n        that supports vibrant economic growth and a thriving middle \n        class.\n            (6) Legislation to address climate change and accelerate \n        the transition to a clean energy economy must be fair, \n        transparent and built to last.\n\nSEC. 3.

Senior coordinator for women and climate change.\nSec. 202. Briefing and report.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Women in the United States and around the world are the \n        linchpin of families and communities and are often the first to \n        feel the immediate and adverse effects of social, \n        environmental, and economic stresses on their families and \n        communities.\n            (2) The United Nations has recognized, as one of the \n        central organizing principles for its work, that ``no enduring \n        solution to society's most threatening social, economic and \n        political problems can be found without the full participation, \n        and the full empowerment, of the world's women''.\n            (3) The United Nations Development Programme 2013 Human \n        Development Report has found that the number of people living \n        in extreme poverty could increase by up to 3,000,000,000 by \n        2050 unless environmental disasters are averted by coordinated \n        global action.\n            (4) Climate change is already forcing vulnerable \n        communities in developing countries to face unprecedented \n        climate stress, including water scarcity and drought, as well \n        as severe weather events and floods, which can lead to reduced \n        agricultural productivity, food insecurity, and increased \n        disease.\n            (5) Climate change exacerbates issues of scarcity and lack \n        of accessibility to primary natural resources, forest \n        resources, and arable land for food production, thereby \n        contributing to increased conflict and instability, as well as \n        the workload and stresses on women farmers, who are estimated \n        to produce 60 to 80 percent of the food in most developing \n        countries.\n            (6) Women will disproportionately face harmful impacts from \n        climate change, particularly in poor and developing nations \n        where women regularly assume increased responsibility for \n        growing the family's food and collecting water, fuel, and other \n        resources.\n            (7) Epidemics, such as malaria and zika, are expected to \n        worsen and spread due to variations in climate, putting women \n        (especially pregnant mothers and women who hope to become \n        pregnant) and children without access to prevention and medical \n        services at risk.\n            (8) The direct and indirect effects of climate change have \n        a disproportionate impact on marginalized women such as refugee \n        and displaced persons, religious or ethnic minorities, \n        adolescent girls, and women and girls with disabilities and \n        those who are living with HIV.\n            (9) Conflict has a disproportionate impact on the most \n        vulnerable populations including women, and is fueled in the \n        world's poorest regions by harsher climate, leading to \n        migration, refugee crises, and conflicts over scarce natural \n        resources including land and water.\n            (10) Displaced, refugee, and stateless women and girls face \n        extreme violence and threats, including--\n                    (A) being forced to exchange sex for food and \n                humanitarian supplies;\n                    (B) being at increased risk of rape, sexual \n                exploitation and abuse; and\n                    (C) being at increased risk for HIV, STIs, \n                unplanned pregnancy, and poor reproductive health.\n            (11) It is predicted that climate change will lead to \n        increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather \n        conditions, precipitating the occurrence of natural disasters \n        around the globe.\n            (12) The relocation and death of women, and especially \n        mothers, as a result of climate-related disasters often has \n        devastating impacts on social support networks, family ties, \n        and the coping capacity of families and communities.\n            (13) The ability of women to adapt to climate change is \n        constrained by a lack of economic freedoms, property and \n        inheritance rights, as well as access to financial resources, \n        education, family planning and reproductive health, and new \n        tools, equipment, and technology.\n            (14) Despite a unique capacity and knowledge to promote and \n        provide for adaptation to climate change, women often have \n        insufficient resources to undertake such adaptation.\n            (15) Women are shown to have a multiplier effect by using \n        their income and resources, when given the necessary tools, to \n        increase the well-being of their children and families, and \n        thus play a critical role in reducing food insecurity, poverty, \n        and socioeconomic effects of climate change.\n            (16) Women are often underrepresented in the development \n        and formulation of policy regarding mitigation and adaptation \n        to climate change, even though they are often in the best \n        position to provide and consult on adaptive strategies.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Change Education Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The evidence for human-induced climate change is \n        overwhelming and undeniable.\n            (2) Atmospheric carbon can be significantly reduced through \n        conservation, by shifting to renewable energy sources such as \n        solar, wind, tidal, and geothermal, and by increasing the \n        efficiency of buildings, including domiciles, and \n        transportation.\n            (3) Providing clear information about climate change, in a \n        variety of forms, can remove the fear and the sense of \n        helplessness, and encourage individuals and communities to take \n        action.\n            (4) Implementation of measures that promote energy \n        efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy will greatly \n        reduce human impact on the environment.\n            (5) Informing people of new technologies and programs as \n        they become available will ensure maximum understanding and \n        maximum effect of those measures.\n            (6) More than 3,000,000 students graduate from high schools \n        and colleges each year, armed with attitudes, skills, and \n        knowledge about the climate that inform their actions.\n            (7) The effect on the climate, positive or negative, of \n        each of those 3,000,000 students lasts beyond a lifetime.\n            (8) Those students need to be prepared to implement changes \n        in professional and personal practices, to support and help \n        develop new technology and policy, and to address the coming \n        social and economic challenges and opportunities arising from a \n        changing climate.\n            (9) It has been demonstrated that the people of the United \n        States overwhelmingly support teaching students about the \n        causes, consequences, and potential solutions to climate change \n        in all 50 States and more than 3,000 counties across the United \n        States.\n            (10) Only 30 percent of middle school and 45 percent of \n        high school science teachers understand the extent of the \n        scientific consensus on climate change.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Produce All Relevant Information to \nSafeguard Climate Act'' or the ``PARIS Climate Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the policy of the United States should reflect and \n        respond to the findings of the Fourth National Climate \n        Assessment, which states that ``the warming trend observed over \n        the past century can only be explained by the effects that \n        human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, \n        have had on the climate'', that ``the evidence of human-caused \n        climate change is overwhelming'', that ``climate-related \n        threats to Americans' physical, social, and economic well-being \n        are rising'', and that ``without substantial and sustained \n        reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions . . . annual \n        losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds \n        of billions of dollars by the end of the century'', in some \n        scenarios reducing gross domestic product by as much as 10 \n        percent;\n            (2) the President and Congress, in formulating a policy \n        response to the findings of the National Climate Assessment, \n        should fully address all of the threats contemplated in such \n        Assessment, including the increasing frequency of heat waves, \n        floods, wildfires, and other extreme weather events, increasing \n        scarcity of water, expanded territory for certain infectious \n        diseases, and diminishing air quality, and should be mindful of \n        low-income communities, communities of color, or other \n        vulnerable populations that are disproportionately impacted by \n        climate change; and\n            (3) in order to best minimize or prevent the harms of which \n        the National Climate Assessment warns, the Federal Government \n        must join with other governments in a concerted global effort \n        to swiftly curtail greenhouse gas and meet the goals \n        established by the Paris Agreement.\n\nSEC. 3. QUARTERLY ASSESSMENTS REGARDING THE PARIS AGREEMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act and quarterly thereafter, the Secretary of State \nshall publish on a publicly available website of the Department of \nState and submit to the appropriate congressional committees an \nassessment that addresses each of the following matters regarding the \nParis Agreement:\n            (1) How many parties to the Paris Agreement have formally \n        indicated an intent to withdraw from such Agreement.\n            (2) Whether the Department has a reasonable expectation \n        that any of the parties referred to in paragraph (1) may pursue \n        withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in the next year, and if \n        so, an identification of such parties and the motives for such \n        withdrawal.\n            (3) Whether the United States has established specific \n        terms for re-engagement with the Paris Agreement, per stated \n        Administration policy at the United Nations \n        (C.N.464.2017.TREATIES-XXVII.7.d) on August 4, 2017.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n        ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n                    (A) in the House of Representatives--\n                            (i) the Committee on Foreign Affairs;\n                            (ii) the Committee on Armed Services;\n                            (iii) the Committee on Natural Resources;\n                            (iv) the Committee on Science, Space, and \n                        Technology; and\n                            (v) the Committee on Energy and Commerce; \n                        and\n                    (B) in the Senate--\n                            (i) the Committee on Foreign Relations;\n                            (ii) the Committee on Armed Services;\n                            (iii) the Committee on the Environment and \n                        Public Works;\n                            (iv) the Committee on Health, Education, \n                        Labor, and Pensions; and\n                            (v) the Committee on Energy and Natural \n                        Resources.\n            (2) Paris agreement.--The term ``Paris Agreement'' means \n        the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's \n        21st Conference of Parties in Paris, France, adopted December \n        12, 2015.\n                                 &lt;all&gt;\n</pre></body></html>\n", "BILLS-115hres1145ih": "<html><body><pre>\n[Congressional Bills 115th Congress]\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\n[H.

which was referred to the \n   Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition to the Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the \n  Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall \n           within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n                               RESOLUTION\n\n\n \n  Recognizing the 2d anniversary of the adoption of the international \n                   Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nWhereas the Paris Agreement, adopted by the Conference of the Parties to the \n        United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 2 years \n        ago on December 12, 2015, represents the first comprehensive agreement \n        among all nations to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius \n        compared with the preindustrial era;\nWhereas the Paris Agreement urges efforts to limit global warming to one and a \n        half degrees Celsius;\nWhereas 197 countries, including the United States, are parties to the UNFCCC, \n        the principal framework to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations at a \n        level that would prevent dangerous human-induced interference with the \n        climate system;\nWhereas 197 parties have signed the Paris Agreement, and 170 parties have \n        ratified the Paris Agreement;\nWhereas the United States is the only country with the intention to withdraw \n        from the Paris Agreement;\nWhereas the human influence on the climate system is unequivocal and evident \n        from the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, \n        positive radiative forcing, observed warming, and understanding of the \n        climate system;\nWhereas, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, without \n        additional mitigation efforts, there is a very high risk that global \n        warming by the end of the twenty-first century will lead to severe, \n        widespread, and irreversible impacts globally;\nWhereas, according to the National Climate Assessment, the global average \n        temperature is projected to increase worldwide by 2.5 to 11.5 degrees \n        Fahrenheit by 2100, which will cause a reduction in crop yields; \n        alteration of hydrological cycles; shrinkage of glaciers and ice sheets; \n        thawing of permafrost at high altitude; increase of flooding, wildfires, \n        droughts, heat waves, cyclones and other extreme weather events; greater \n        risk of species extinctions; and more;\nWhereas, according to the National Climate Assessment, the global sea level is \n        projected to rise another 0.8 to 6.6 feet by 2100 while ocean warming \n        and acidification increases, causing a proportional increase in \n        destructive coastal storms and surges, disruption of ecosystems \n        including spawning and migration patterns of key fisheries, displacement \n        of people on vulnerable coastlines and islands, and more;\nWhereas the Government Accountability Office found that climate-related impacts, \n        such as coastal property damage, cost the Federal Government $350 \n        billion;\nWhereas a November 2016 assessment by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \n        and the Council of Economic Advisers found that recurring costs as a \n        result of climate change could increase the Federal Government's \n        expenses by $12 billion to $35 billion a year by midcentury, possibly \n        reaching more than $100 billion annually by the end of the century;\nWhereas climate change not only threatens our world's weather, biodiversity, and \n        ecosystems, but also threatens human security, economic vitality, and \n        social stability around the globe;\nWhereas the effects of climate change will only exacerbate issues of resource \n        scarcity, including lack of access to primary natural resources such as \n        fresh water and arable land for food production, thereby contributing to \n        increased conflict, poverty, food insecurity, and instability;\nWhereas this increased conflict and instability, as well as limited capacity to \n        adapt to extreme weather, may force large-scale displacement and \n        internal and cross-border migration of people, thereby contributing to \n        increased risks to human security and economic systems;\nWhereas the impacts of climate change will often be most severely felt by poor \n        and socially excluded groups, such as ethnic minorities, women, older \n        people, and children, whose capacity to adapt to both rapid- and slow-\n        onset climate change is more limited;\nWhereas the global community can limit the risks of climate change by reducing \n        emissions of greenhouse gases and strengthening the capacity of \n        communities to adapt to climate change;\nWhereas, to enable developing countries to combat climate change and adapt to \n        its impacts, developed countries will need to mobilize economic \n        resources, beginning with fulfilling their pledge of mobilizing $100 \n        billion of climate financing from both public and private sources \n        annually beginning in 2020, some of which will support the Green Climate \n        Fund;\nWhereas the United States pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 \n        percent below 2005 levels in the United States by 2030, and to \n        contribute $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund;\nWhereas the economy of the United States grew by 15 percent between 2005 and \n        2015, while net greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 11.5 percent \n        during that period;\nWhereas 30 States have adopted renewable electricity standard requirements, 20 \n        States have adopted greenhouse gas emissions targets, 20 States have \n        adopted energy efficiency resource standards, 10 States have adopted \n        zero-emission vehicle targets, and 9 States have implemented the \n        Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and additional States may soon join;\nWhereas 47 cities in the United States have adopted 100 percent clean and \n        renewable energy goals;\nWhereas the States, cities, Tribal nations, businesses, and institutions of \n        higher education of the United States that support the objectives of the \n        Paris Agreement represent more than half of the gross domestic product \n        of the United States; and\nWhereas the Paris Agreement secured commitments from other member countries, \n        including China and India, for a global agreement that could prevent \n        catastrophic changes to our climate system and thus to societies around \n        the world: Now, therefore, be it\n    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n            (1) recognizes the 2d anniversary of the adoption of the \n        Paris Agreement;\n            (2) acknowledges it is the responsibility of humankind to \n        address the severe and global impacts of climate change;\n            (3) supports global efforts that will keep global warming \n        below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), including \n        reduction of greenhouse gas emissions;\n            (4) supports global efforts to protect those most \n        vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including \n        increasing the ambition of current climate financing goals;\n            (5) supports policies at the Federal, State, and local \n        level that promote the reduction of greenhouse gas pollution \n        and aim to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement; and\n            (6) recommends that the United States remain a signatory to \n        the Paris Agreement.\n                                 &lt;all&gt;\n</pre></body></html>\n", "BILLS-115hres825ih": "<html><body><pre>\n[Congressional Bills 115th Congress]\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\n[H.
