BREAKDOWN OF COST ESTIMATES BY BUDGET FUNCTION.\\n\\n    Any cost estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office shall \\nspecify the percentage of the estimated cost that is within each budget \\nfunction.\\n\\nSEC. 4007. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TREATMENT OF REDUCTION OF \\n              APPROPRIATIONS LEVELS TO ACHIEVE SAVINGS.\\n\\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) H. Con. Res. 448 (96th Congress), the concurrent \\n        resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1981, gave authorizing \\n        committees reconciliation instructions which amounted to \\n        approximately two-thirds of the savings required under \\n        reconciliation.\\n            (2) The language in H. Con. Res. 448 resulted in a debate \\n        about how reconciling discretionary spending programs could be \\n        in order given that authorizations of appropriations for \\n        programs did not actually change spending and the programs \\n        authorized would be funded through later annual appropriation. \\n        The staff of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate and the \\n        counsel to the Majority Leader advised that upon consultation \\n        with the Parliamentarian, the original instructions on \\n        discretionary spending would be out of order because of the \\n        phrase, ``to modify programs''. This was seen as too broad and \\n        programs could be modified without resulting in changes to \\n        their future appropriations.\\n            (3) To rectify this violation, the Committee on the Budget \\n        of the Senate reported S. Con. Res. 9 (97th Congress), revising \\n        the congressional budget for the United States Government for \\n        fiscal years 1981, 1982, and 1983, to include reconciliation, \\n        which revised the language in the reconciliation instructions \\n        to change entitlement law and ``to report changes in laws \\n        within the jurisdiction of that committee sufficient to reduce \\n        appropriations levels so as to achieve savings''.\\n            (4) This was understood to mean changes in authorization \\n        language of discretionary programs would be permissible under \\n        reconciliation procedures provided such changes in law would \\n        have the result in affecting a change in later outlays derived \\n        from future appropriations. Further it was understood that a \\n        change in authorization language that caused a change in later \\n        outlays was considered to be a change in outlays for the \\n        purpose of reconciliation.\\n            (5) On April 2, 1981, the Senate voted 88 to 10 to approve \\n        S. Con. Res. 9 with the modified reconciliation language.\\n    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \\ncommittees reporting changes in laws within the jurisdiction of that \\ncommittee sufficient to reduce appropriations levels so as to achieve \\nsavings shall be considered to be changes in outlays for the purpose of \\nenforcing the prohibition on extraneous matters in reconciliation \\nbills.\\n\\nSEC. 4008. PROHIBITION ON PREEMPTIVE WAIVERS.\\n\\n    In the Senate, it shall not be in order to move to waive or suspend \\na point of order under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. \\n621 et seq.) or any concurrent resolution on the budget with respect to \\na bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between the \\nHouses, or conference report unless the point of order has been \\nspecifically raised by a Senator.\\n\\nSEC. 4009. ADJUSTMENTS FOR LEGISLATION REDUCING APPROPRIATIONS.\\n\\n    The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may \\nrevise the allocations in effect under section 302(a) of the \\nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 633(a)) and the allocations \\nof a committee or committees, aggregates, and other appropriate levels \\nin this resolution for any bill or joint resolution considered pursuant \\nto section 2001 containing the recommendations of one or more \\ncommittees, or for one or more amendments to, a conference report on, \\nor an amendment between the Houses in relation to such a bill or joint \\nresolution, by the amounts necessary to accommodate the reduction in \\nthe amount of discretionary appropriations for a fiscal year caused by \\nthe measure.\\n\\nSEC. 4010. AUTHORITY.\\n\\n    Congress adopts this title under the authority under section \\n301(b)(4) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 632(b)(4)).\\n\\nSEC. 4011. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\\n\\n    Congress adopts the provisions of this title--\\n            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate, \\n        and as such they shall be considered as part of the rules of \\n        the Senate and such rules shall supersede other rules only to \\n        the extent that they are inconsistent with such other rules; \\n        and\\n            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \\n        the Senate to change those rules at any time, in the same \\n        manner, and to the same extent as is the case of any other rule \\n        of the Senate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                       Calendar No. 384\\n\\n115th CONGRESS\\n\\n  2d Session\\n\\n                            S.

BREAKDOWN OF COST ESTIMATES BY BUDGET FUNCTION.\\n\\n    Any cost estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office shall \\nspecify the percentage of the estimated cost that is within each budget \\nfunction.\\n\\nSEC. 4007. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TREATMENT OF REDUCTION OF \\n              APPROPRIATIONS LEVELS TO ACHIEVE SAVINGS.\\n\\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) H. Con. Res. 448 (96th Congress), the concurrent \\n        resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1981, gave authorizing \\n        committees reconciliation instructions which amounted to \\n        approximately two-thirds of the savings required under \\n        reconciliation.\\n            (2) The language in H. Con. Res. 448 resulted in a debate \\n        about how reconciling discretionary spending programs could be \\n        in order given that authorizations of appropriations for \\n        programs did not actually change spending and the programs \\n        authorized would be funded through later annual appropriation. \\n        The staff of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate and the \\n        counsel to the Majority Leader advised that upon consultation \\n        with the Parliamentarian, the original instructions on \\n        discretionary spending would be out of order because of the \\n        phrase, ``to modify programs''. This was seen as too broad and \\n        programs could be modified without resulting in changes to \\n        their future appropriations.\\n            (3) To rectify this violation, the Committee on the Budget \\n        of the Senate reported S. Con. Res. 9 (97th Congress), revising \\n        the congressional budget for the United States Government for \\n        fiscal years 1981, 1982, and 1983, to include reconciliation, \\n        which revised the language in the reconciliation instructions \\n        to change entitlement law and ``to report changes in laws \\n        within the jurisdiction of that committee sufficient to reduce \\n        appropriations levels so as to achieve savings''.\\n            (4) This was understood to mean changes in authorization \\n        language of discretionary programs would be permissible under \\n        reconciliation procedures provided such changes in law would \\n        have the result in affecting a change in later outlays derived \\n        from future appropriations. Further it was understood that a \\n        change in authorization language that caused a change in later \\n        outlays was considered to be a change in outlays for the \\n        purpose of reconciliation.\\n            (5) On April 2, 1981, the Senate voted 88 to 10 to approve \\n        S. Con. Res. 9 with the modified reconciliation language.\\n    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \\ncommittees reporting changes in laws within the jurisdiction of that \\ncommittee sufficient to reduce appropriations levels so as to achieve \\nsavings shall be considered to be changes in outlays for the purpose of \\nenforcing the prohibition on extraneous matters in reconciliation \\nbills.\\n\\nSEC. 4008. PROHIBITION ON PREEMPTIVE WAIVERS.\\n\\n    In the Senate, it shall not be in order to move to waive or suspend \\na point of order under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. \\n621 et seq.) or any concurrent resolution on the budget with respect to \\na bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between the \\nHouses, or conference report unless the point of order has been \\nspecifically raised by a Senator.\\n\\nSEC. 4009. ADJUSTMENTS FOR LEGISLATION REDUCING APPROPRIATIONS.\\n\\n    The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may \\nrevise the allocations in effect under section 302(a) of the \\nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 633(a)) and the allocations \\nof a committee or committees, aggregates, and other appropriate levels \\nin this resolution for any bill or joint resolution considered pursuant \\nto section 2001 containing the recommendations of one or more \\ncommittees, or for one or more amendments to, a conference report on, \\nor an amendment between the Houses in relation to such a bill or joint \\nresolution, by the amounts necessary to accommodate the reduction in \\nthe amount of discretionary appropriations for a fiscal year caused by \\nthe measure.\\n\\nSEC. 4010.
